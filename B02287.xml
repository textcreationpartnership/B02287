            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But natural motion is alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with Life; how then can that produce Life and motion in another, that hath them not in it ſelf? Motion never forſakes that which hath Life; and that which either moves, or is moved alwayes, cannot want Life: The Soul of the Univerſe moving it ſelf ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, is the fountain and original of all corporal motion; for the moſt ſubtile part of this Mundane Soul, ſoaring high, and inhabiting the Heavens, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually wheeled about with the Celeſtial Bodies, which it ſelf circumduces with its proper and continual motion: and for this Reaſon, the ſuperiour Bodies are more lively and perfect then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, becauſe they are continually moved orbicularly; and that which is moved continually, muſt needs be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. And thus it appears, that the whole World is full of Life; and, that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:174321:22"/>
the Life of every ſpecies and individual, is but a participation of this Univerſal Life of the World, which alone may be properly called an Animal, in whoſe corporal Elements, the ſeeds of all vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and corporal thing are hidden and included: for we ſee many Plants grow without precedent ſeeds, and many A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals produced without copulation of Male with Female. The viſible ſeed of Plants lies in their Grains, of Animals, in their Genitors: Metals alſo have their ſeed, but ſuch as is not viſible but by true Philoſophers, who know how with great induſtry to extract it from its proper ſubject. And unleſs there be a certain procreative faculty in the Elements, wherein Generation is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentially included, many Herbs would ſcarce germinate on the Earth, much leſs on high Walls where no ſeed was ever ſown, nor Herb planted; neither would ſo many kindes of Animals be generated in the Earth or Water with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out copulation of Sexes, as there are, which do by copulation afterwards, perpetuate their ſpecies, though them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were not generated by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:174321:23"/>
of any Parents; as we ſee in Snakes generated of Mud; and Flies, and other little Animals, of Excrements. Again, How do Oyſters, Sea-Spunges, and other Aquatical Creatures live, which rather merit the name of Plant-animals, then of Fiſhes? Theſe do not ſo much live by any particular Life proper to themſelves, as by that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal one, general and common to all; which is more vigorous in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Bodies, as more neer to it, then in groſſer ones, which are more remote from it.</p>
               <p>The World then, created wholly good, by him that is Goodneſs it ſelf, is not corporal ſolely, but participates of ſpirituality and intelligence: <hi>(for it is full of all manner of forms:)</hi> and, as I ſaid before, hath neither part nor mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but that 's vital; and therefore wiſe-men have called it a Maſculine and Feminine, or Hermaphroditical Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, one part holding a certain Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Alligation with another. And hence, by a certain Tranſlation, ariſes the diverſity of Sexes in Plants and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; which, in imitation of the World,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:174321:23"/>
copulate together, and generate a third like themſelves: for the World pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an infinity of little Worlds; for every Body in the World that is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, is a Microcoſm, having diſtinct parts, vertues, and qualities belonging to a little World. So that every thing hath an inclination to generate a thing like it ſelf, by the right ordering of Action and Paſſion; which could not be, if all things were not full of Life: for what Generation can proceed from a dead ſubject, ſeeing it is neither probable nor poſſible, that that can communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Life to another, that wants Life it ſelf?</p>
               <p>We ſee indeed ſometimes, many things are generated without the congreſs of Male and Female, yea, without the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of either, whereinto the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Spirit infuſes Life by means of Fomentation; as many by Artifice, who exclude Eggs and Chickins without the ſitting of a Hen: and others, who by preparing certain matters, and putrefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, produce wonderful Animals, as the Baſilisk of a Cocks Egg, or of the menſtruous matter of a red Hen, Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

alike in all ſubjects, but diverſified as there is more or leſs of it in the ſeeds. All matters of purer pre-diſpoſitions, have a purer and more durable Life and Spirit: for every thing delighting in that that 's likeſt to it, it is more then Reaſon, that this pure Celeſtial vigour ſhould penetrate and ſink deeper into purer Bodies, and make them more durable and vital. For the proof of which, we need go no further then Gold which, being purer then all other Terreſtrial Bodies, participates more of that Celeſtial Fire, which, penetrating the bowels of the Earth, findes in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals the pre-diſpoſed matter (to wit, the <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which <hi>Eſdras</hi> calls, <hi>The Earth of Gold</hi>) prepared by the action and diligence of Nature, and purged and ſeparated from all inquina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Terreſtrial and aduſt Dregs: which matter, in the beginning, is onely ſome Sperm or Water mix'd with that Sperm, Powder or pure Sulphur; which, acted by the coagulative faculty, thickens by little and little; and in time, by long and continued action of the heat, hardens, and ſo comes to its perfection,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:174321:29"/>
which is naturally ſimple, tincted with the colour of Fire: for heat is the Progenitor and Parent of Tinctures. If therefore it be certain, that this heat comes from the Sun, as it muſt needs be indubitable, who can ſo much contradict Truth and Reaſon, as to deny the Sun to be the Author and Parent of this perfection? Let us then look higher, and ſeek more accurately how this perfection may be cauſed by this mean.</p>

               <p>BUt ſome may here ſay, If all things proceed from one and the ſame matter, how can the Sun be called the Parent of this matter, when it ſelf is procreated or produced out of this matter? For anſwer whereunto, we muſt conſider, That if we ſpeak of the primaeve prejacent matter of all things, it is altogether inviſible, and cannot be comprehended but by ſtrong imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; out of whoſe vital light and natural heat, this Celeſtial Sun was produced, with equal light and fiery vigour: which afterwards, ſtrengthening this internal and eſſential heat, with natural, diſplayed the beams of his Fire over the whole Univerſe, illuminating
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:174321:30"/>
the Stars above him, and vivifying th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> things below him. But becauſe the Earth is, as it were, the common Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all things, the Sun acts moſt vigorouſly upon her, ſhe being the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Receptacle of all Influences, in whoſe bowels the ſeeds of all things are abſconded; which being agitated and moved by the Suns heat, come to light: and for this cauſe, in Winter, when the Sun is furtheſt abſent from us, the Earth being deſtituted of that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous heat which his perpendicular Rayes brought with them, ſhe is we ſee barren, and produces nothing: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Spring, when the Sun again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views our Climate, then ſhe riſes from her ſleep or death, and receives Life and vigour. The cauſe of which mutation, muſt needs be the Univerſal Spirit full of Life, inhabiting the Earth principally; which, before it can generate any thing, muſt take up its Inn in ſome Body, as in the Earth, which is the Body of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and becauſe all things are nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſuſtained by that which produces them, there muſt be great affinity and harmony betwixt this Spirit and the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:174321:30"/>
Sun. And for this cauſe ancient Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſay, That the Sun in the Spring-time, calefies and enlivens his Parent loaden with old age, and almoſt killed with Winter-cold. Seeing then ſhe is by the Sun fortified, enlivened and impregnated, <hi>Hermes</hi> had reaſon to ſay, That the Sun was the Father of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for being otherwiſe barren, and without off-ſpring, ſhe now conceives, generates and multiplies her ſpirituous matter, leading it from incorporality to corporality.</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Hortulanus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting on <hi>Hermes</hi> his Table, leaves and omits the radical principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and taking his riſe by the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Chymiſtry by the Sun, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Philoſophers Gold, which he truely calls the Parent of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone.

principle of all the three chief kindes, comprehending the whole of the world) he had attained ſo much of knowledge and wiſdom, that nothing could lie hid from his eyes: and this principle he makes one. So that all things are produced from one, by mediation of one, and adaptation to one. This One then of which he ſpeaks, is that general Spirit whereof I treat: and that One, by which he ſayes, Miracles may be wrought, is the true Mineral matter of the Stone, whereof we ſpoke even now, which is produced from the firſt general matter, or univerſal Spirit, in the Earth, by Nature; which Spirit potentially containing all Celeſtial vertues in it ſelf, communicates ſo much to this Mineral matter, as is requiſite for the obtaining of its perfection.</p>
               <p>But omitting Chymical Doctrines as much as we may in this Treatiſe, we ſay, That this general Spirit is a Stone or Elixir compoſed by Nature; by mediation whereof, ſhe works all her Miracles: which is much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable then the Alchymiſts Stone, which is onely a grant of this univerſal

               <p>WInde is nothing but Air moved and agitated, as we may learn from the reſpiration of Animals, which blow Winde when they breath Air.

But by Mountains (ſaith <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinus</hi>) the Philoſopher means Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites; by the tops of their Mountains, Alembicks: by reaping, he means, we muſt receive the Water of the aforeſaid things, through the Alembick into the Receptacle: by reducing them to their Roots, he means, That we ſhould reduce the ſaid Water to the Earth whence it aroſe. This is alſo confirmed by <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enus,</hi> who ſaith, That the Philoſophers operations conſiſt onely in extracting Water from the Earth, and reducing it to the Earth till the Earth putrefie: for the Earth putrefies, when this Water is purified; which, being once pure, will by God's help, direct and perfect the whole Magiſtry.</p>
               <p>Some have exploded Air out of the order of the Elements, thinking it as glue or lime to conjoyn divers Natures; judging it the Spirit or Inſtrument of the World, becauſe it is the Chariot of the Univerſal Spirit: for it firſt receives the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:174321:38"/>
influences of all Celeſtial Bodies, and communicates them to other Elements and mix'd Bodies. In the mean while, like ſome divine Looking-glaſs, receiving and retaining the ſpecies and forms of all natural things, which it carries along with it, and inſinuating it ſelf into the pores of Animals, impreſſes thoſe forms on them, whether they ſleep or wake. We learn from Animals and Vegetables, That every Spirit neer the Earth, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives its vertue and vigor from the Air: for we ſee ſuch things encreaſe and extol themſelves: the Spirit which gives them Life, doth ſo much delight in Air, as the place where it had its origine. <hi>Hermes</hi> alſo ſaith, That the Air carries it in its belly. Whereunto <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſubſcribes, ſaying, That moiſt things proceed from the Air, and Terrene things from the moiſt ones: for Air being next the Earth, humectares it on every ſide; and the humour thereof being condenſed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat, is turned into a certain kinde of Earth, which contains <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> in due proportions.</p>

               <p>THough this Spirit be infuſed into, and dwells in ſuperiour as well as inferiour Bodies, yet it may be beſt known and diſcerned in Bodies moſt evident and neer to our view; of which the Earth is neereſt, and moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable: in it therefore is this Spirit generated, and manifeſted more copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: for the Earth is a certain mark, whereto all the Influences, Rayes, and Vertues of the ſuperiour Bodies tend. It is moreover the Fundament and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the other Elements, containing in it ſelf the ſeeds and ſeminal vertues of all things; for which cauſe it is rightly called the common Mother of all Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, Vegetables and Minerals. It is therefore impregnated by the Heavens, and produces all things out of its
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:174321:39"/>
womb; and though this Spirit were expelled, waſhed away, or ſeparated from it by what way you pleaſe, yet the Earth, thus void of Spirit, if left a while in the Air, would again be impregnated by the Celeſtial vertues and influences, ſo as to produce ſome Chyſtalline ſtones, and lucent ſparks: and by this means, the Spirit which was taken for ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, would again regerminate in the Earth. Impregnation then made by the action of the Heavens, and of the firſt qualities, doth continually render her generative: for out of her womb come all things ſublunary. She produces all things endued with life, preſerves, nouriſhes, and at laſt reſolves them into their own Nature. When ſhe is agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by theſe actions, ſhe cauſes a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold expiration; one without her, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within her: which expirations egrede from this Terrene Spirit, when moved and calefied by the Celeſtial heat. The expiration elevated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or above the Earth, if it be humid, cauſes and produces dew and froſt; if dry, winde, thunder, and other dry Aereal impreſſions: but the expiration
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:174321:39"/>
included in the Earth, if it be humid, generates liquable Metals and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals; if dry, ſtones, and the like, that are not liquable. All things vegetable proceed from, and are nouriſhed by this Spirit, whereof the Earth is Nurſe: for which cauſe, the ancient Poets call the Earth the common Mother and Nurſe of all Creatures.</p>

               <p>THe Univerſal Spirit is the general Genus, and common to every Genus: for if we caſt our eyes into the inferiour or elementary World, we ſee it divided into three ſubalternals, to wit, animal, vegetable, and mineral kindes, and yet the ſame in all, onely operating diverſly according to the diverſity of its forms. And hence the infinite variety of Creatures ariſes; for elſe there would be only one ſpecies in the Univerſe: but if we perpend the ſuperiour and Celeſtial World, we ſhall alſo finde, That the Spirit is one, equal in all, and differing in nothing but purity and ſubtilty: for the Celeſtial Spirits are procreated of its pure igneous ſubſtance, and differ from Terrene ones in corporal groſneſs:
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:174321:40"/>
and the Celeſtial Globes and Lumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are made of its middle and Aereal ſubſtance: it conſtitutes therefore all things, becauſe it hath in it both the faculties of ſuperior and inferior Bodies, and becauſe it is of an exquiſite temper: for this Body is in all the beginning and end of perfection; and if it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted of its faculties, it could never perfect any thing: and here we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſimple and natural perfection; and although it be perfect onely, according to the intent of Nature, containing in it ſelf the rule, line, action and power of perfection; yet it acquires vertues and faculties above the ſphere of natural things, and can deduce things from po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency to act. This Spirit alters and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates all things, though never ſo groſs; mollifies hard things, hardens ſoft things, and augments, nouriſhes and conſerves all things. This Spirit alſo, being in all Bodies the Author of Generation and Corruption, hath neceſſarily a threefold operation: for by its drineſs, it muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven; and by its coldneſs, congeal; and by its moiſture, congregate and unite: for which it hath a threefold

                  <hi>Glaſs,</hi> but <hi>Salt,</hi> that cauſes the indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bones, Shells, and the like, which I have mentioned. Whereunto I anſwer, That Experience and Reaſon ſpeak the contrary: for <hi>Salt</hi> is reſolved and melted by the leaſt moiſture of Air or Water: but the Bones and Shells before mentioned, reſiſt liquefaction, as they are more or leſs hardened by this <hi>Glaſs</hi>-making faculty: for the ultimate confirmation of which my aſſertion, I may adduce precious Stones, <hi>Adamant</hi> and <hi>Chryſtal,</hi> which are nothing but <hi>Glaſs</hi> elaborated to perfection in the Furnace of Nature.

by the univerſal Spirit. We now come to declare what kinde of Body this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit aſſumes, and how it ſelf both is, and makes all things corporeal: for that muſt needs be corporeal which makes all other things ſuch, ſeeing nothing can give what it ſelf hath not. Let us therefore ſee with what, and how it is veſted with a Body: not that we will here diſpute of the incorporation of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial and ſupernatural beings, but onely of Phyſical and Sublunary Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and of the body of the Earth, which is the ſole veſſel and true matrix, where the prime and moſt general Incorporator of things, is it ſelf incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated.</p>

               <p>But ſome may ſay, If vapour come
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:174321:46"/>
from fire, how can it be moiſt, ſeeing fire is hot and dry? whence acquires it this contrary quality? And here we finde nothing abſurd, if we do but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That fire cannot live and ſubſiſt without moiſture, which is its aliment, ſupport and ſubject; without which, fire cannot be conceived: for being by Nature active, and its action indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, it muſt needs have ſomething to act upon, and never be deſtitute of this thing.</p>
               <p>Fire then, and co-eſſential moiſture, are like Male and Female in all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and are the firſt Parents of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porification of the Spirit of the World; as hereafter we ſhall make appear. But Fire is the firſt Operator, becauſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction precedes paſſion, though the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be inſeparably co-exiſtent with the Agent; as the old Stoick <hi>Zenon</hi> aſſerts, who thought that the ſubſtance of Fire was by Air turned into Water, and there conſerved, as the general Sperm, and firſt univerſal matter, whence all things were firſt generated. <hi>Thales Mileſius,</hi> whom the Greeks ſurnamed the wiſe, perceiving the matter patient,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:174321:47"/>
ſaid, That Water was the firſt matter: which <hi>Heraclitus</hi> attributed to the Sea: and <hi>Moſes,</hi> more illuminated then both, ſaith, That <hi>before the heaven and earth were created, the Spirit of the Lord moved on the face of the waters:</hi> calling Fire, becauſe of its noble and pure eſſence, The Spirit of God. In ſaying therefore, That Fire is the firſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of beings, I tranſgreſs not the limits of Reaſon and Verity: for it is without doubt, the firſt Operator, and the laſt Deſtroyer and Changer of forms, whoſe cauſe it is, even till it hath brought them to their period and firſt matter, beyond which there is no progreſs, but onely a transformation, as I ſhall by and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, by compariſon with viſible and familiar beings: the firſt active potency, which begins to operate in the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of man, is the agitation or motion of heat: which imitating the action of fire (whoſe Nature is chiefly ſeparative) draws Sperm from the whole Body (wherein Man's ſeed is potentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded) and cocts and digeſts it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rendring it apt for expulſion, and afterwards for Generation and Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:174321:47"/>
which Generation and Augmentation is alwayes helped by Fire, which is the ſole Actor: ſo that if it ſhould attain the end of its exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, being inflamed by the Sulphur of Excrements, and impurity of Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it would abſume the radical Moiſture, which is the Seat and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of Life: which done, the fire remits not of its power and action, till by reſolution and corruption, it brings the Body to Aſhes; which nothing can do but fire.</p>
               <p>But that we may make this more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and finde out the firſt matter by the knowledge of the laſt, let us impoſe a Body on a common Fire: and we ſhall ſee, that what is inflammable in it, will be totally conſumed, and redacted to a few Aſhes; which Aſhes alſo will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of a fiery Nature; and for their laſt ſubject and matter, turn into a certain Salt, whoſe ſole Parent and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplier, Fire muſt needs be. And though theſe ſhould be further turned, yet Salt would alwayes be left, in whoſe inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals we may finde Fire, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with its like.</p>

               <p>And hence we may eaſily underſtand, That the <hi>Demogorgon</hi> or central Fire, cannot be deſtitute of moiſture on which it may act, and thence elevate a vapour mixed of two qualities, which I call, The Spirit of the World; but many Philoſophers <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> becauſe all other proceed from this naturally: but this elevated vapour is not yet a Body, but a mean betwixt a Body and a Spirit, participating of both Natures; which, whilſt it remains in that ſtate, can generate nothing. It is therefore neceſſary, That it either aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or form a Body, which it thus
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:174321:51"/>
doth: This ſubtile vapour, proceeding from dry and moiſt principles, when it is elevated, penetrates the ſpungyneſs of the Earth, wherein it is gradually turned into Mercurial Water by the occurſe of the ambient Air, and of the Earth it ſelf; whoſe ſurface is far diſtant from its Centre, where the Fire reſides, whence this heat ariſes. After the like manner, as we ſee in an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, where the vapour or Spirit to be diſtilled, runs out. But this vapour and its water, partaking of two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, heat and moiſture, it is ingroſſed; and by moderate and continued cocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, condenſed. The principal cauſe and mean of which action, is innate Fire, which contains this very vapour; and by its continual action, ſtimulates and compels it to imbibe this moiſture, and to coagulate this Water: not in all parts with a like ſolidity and hardneſs, nor yet altogether; but firſt with a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilaginous and different ſolidity. Now that which Nature aſſayes to do in the information of Idea's, is, to begin their induration and ſolidity, which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily hold on in Natures way, which
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:174321:51"/>
is a progreſs from one extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by intermediate diſpoſition. And Nature thus continuing its digeſtion, this Mucilage ſtays, of whoſe groſſer matter Metals are generated in the veins of the Earth, or cavities of Rocks; which differ not in ſubſtance, being produced by one and the ſame ſeed, but onely in accidents, which they take from the diverſities of the places and matrixes where they are generated. But the more ſubtile part of this vapour, aſcends to the ſurface of the Earth, where it ſtays by compulſion; and being in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual agitation, though it can neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grede nor aſcend higher, and finding no ſolid matter to carry it with it, it is compelled to continue Natures inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore ſerves for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Corporification of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals. But that what I have ſaid may be better underſtood, let us take ſome one individual, and let us ſee how it is produced: for this will aſcertain us, that the Spirit of the World aſſumes a Body, and ſhew us how it is incorporated. An Acorn may be long enough ſet or ſown in the Earth, and conſume without ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:174321:52"/>
unleſs ſome Agent be neer it, that may deduce its occult potency na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally within it, into act. And whence can any one imagine this action to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, unleſs from the central Fire iſſuing out of <hi>Demogorgon</hi>'s breſt? Which Fire attracted and fomented by the Solar Rayes, will redouble its force, vertue, and efficacy. Does not then this ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination derive its original from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Fire; which elevating and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying its vapour, excites the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat of the Acorn, which is of its own ſide reſolved into a vapour by the mediation of Air? and this raiſed vapour is nouriſhed and augmented by the firſt vapour, which never ceaſes to act on the matter of the Acorn, till it have brought it to the period of that perfection to which Nature deſtined it, which is, to make it an Oak: which, when it hath acquired its perfect mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, begins, not indeed to die, but to decline, and gradually to return to its firſt form, even to the Earth; where the ſame vapour is not idle or deficient: for of the putritude of this Tree, certain Animals, called Horſe-lice, with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:174321:52"/>
of Worms, are thereby gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; yea, when the Oak is turned into perfect Earth, it cauſes a new vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>But if any ſhould ſay, That the Acorn is augmented and multiplied to this magnitude, he erres: for it is manifeſt, That in this germination, the Acorn remains whole without diminution; yea, ſeparates it ſelf from the Tree when it is germinated. The Oak then grows not from the augmentation and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Acorn; neither is it from addition and abſtraction from the adjacent Earth: for then ſo much of the Earth would be exhauſted, as the Trees magnitude is: it muſt therefore neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed from ſome other way &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſeeing by theſe wayes it cannot. This Spirit then, or Vapour, which is ordained for no other end, is that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated, and produces this indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, from which the creation, augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and preſervation of all things, proceed; and not from the Maſs of the Earth, which is nothing but the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſpirituous and primaeve mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as it appears by the digeſtion of the

therefore be extracted by them, becauſe otherwiſe, they forſake the direct tract of Nature: and ſeeing it is made a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Body, it may be perfected by Fire, into ſomething, which the Quinteſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials call their Heaven. But corporifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation begins from the Earth: for the firſt work of <hi>Mercury</hi> is to make Earth. Why then do they begin with making of Fire? which would proceed, as if a Man ſhould build a Houſe, and begin at the Roof.</p>
               <p>But ſuch as would reduce Bodies to their firſt being, pretend; and have more ſpecious Reaſons, then thoſe that would redact them to a Quinteſſence, ſave that they go in a crooked way that leads them contrary to their meanings: for, beſides that Nature never goes back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, they minde not that they ſhould follow the way of completion, and not of deſtruction, or reverſion to their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines and nativity: for, beſides the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of this courſe, theſe wayes are ſo long and difficult, that an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary term of Life cannot reach their end. Moreover, they can never attain the true and natural firſt Being this way,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:174321:55"/>
but onely a phantaſtical Body, far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that wherewith Nature effects her productive operations; which is ſolely, the legitimate Sperm of all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. And if we conſider now, That all Bodies are made by Terrification, we muſt needs grant, That there is ſome prejacent ſubject moſt apt for the making of Earth. But I ſaid, That in the beginning Fire was the firſt Operator in the World, which elevates a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vapour, then cocts, dries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporates it: for a Body cannot be made without coagulation, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows the drineſs of Fire: And in what other place can this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſation, deſiccation and coagulation be made, ſave in the Earth, whence all Bodies proceed? The prejacent matter then, muſt needs be there occluded; for if it be not there, then all Bodies are made of nothing; which is repugnant to Natures courſe, which would have every thing to have its principle; and out of nothing, nothing but nothing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
               <p>This matter or principle then is bound to the Body of the Earth, where it is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:174321:55"/>
nouriſhed, ingroſſed and incorporated; and therefore, ſuch as would extract the Quinteſſence out of perfect, ſimple, or imperfect Metals, ſhould do better to open the Matrix of the Mother, and take the Sperm out there, then to kill and deſtroy her Infants or adult Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, while they go about to reduce them to the ſtate wherein they were in time of conception. But if they ſhould open this Matrix, what would they there finde? for nothing appears to ſight or ſenſe. And many believing this way moſt profitable, have been deceived, whilſt they thought in the bellies of Mynes, to finde ſome ſeed of Gold; which miſſing of, they deſpair of their purpoſe, becauſe they never met with a middle diſpoſition betwixt hardneſs and ſoftneſs in Metals. If therefore the eye can diſcern nothing here, how then is it poſſible for them to get any thing? This indeed is a work, the other a labour. Such Searchers ſurely believe not, that the firſt matter is ſo ſubtile and looſe a Spirit or Vapour, as that it cannot be reached, ſave onely by intellect and imagination.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:174321:56"/>
However, ſeeing it is contained in the Body of this great Parent, and dwells there, Reaſon evinces, That it hath ſomething of corporeity in it: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have ſufficiently declared to ſubtile intellects of what Nature it is, I ſhall further add, That the Pores of the Earth are full of this Vapour, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a dry quality by its innate heat, accompanied with ſome ſecret moiſture, by which it is condenſed, and coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into a ſpecifical Body: and as this moiſt Nature, now dried up, was firſt Water; ſo it muſt be reduced into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters again by Water, which is the ſole mean whereby to humectate dry things, as fire is to ſiccate moiſt things: which is a work duely obſerved by Nature in generating Metals: for Water flowing through the Pores of the Earth, findes there a diſſoluble ſubſtance, wherewith it unites its moſt ſimple parts: to which union, all the Elements concur in due proportion.</p>
               <p>This ſubſtance then, by its own diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution is ſo conjoyned, that it of it ſelf condenſes through hardneſs, which is natural to it, becauſe of its innate
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:174321:56"/>
ſiccity; and by ſucceſſive and long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, acquires a metallical indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But now this ſubſtance being diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, of what other Nature can it participate, but of Salt? for nothing is ſo diſſoluble as Salt; which by how much it is more burned, is by ſo much eaſier diſſolved, unleſs it be turned into Glaſs.</p>
               <p>The firſt matter then, is Salt; or Salt is the firſt Body whereby this matter becomes viſible or palpable: of which Salt <hi>Raymundus</hi> ſpeaks, when, in his <hi>Testament,</hi> he ſaith, We have before declared, That in the Centre of the Earth, there is a certain Virgin-Earth, and true Element, and that that is Natures work. Nature therefore is placed in the Centre of every thing: ſo Salt is this Virgin-Earth which hath yet produced nothing, into which the Spirit of the World is converted by vitrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, by extenuation of its moiſture. This is that which gives the form to all things, and without which, nothing could incur into the ſenſes; nothing is coagulated without Salt,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:174321:57"/>
nothing congealed. This is that that gives hardneſs to Gold, as alſo to the Adamant and all Stones both precious and vulgar, with a Secret vitrifying Vertue. Yea, what is more, we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly ſee, that all Bodies, compounded of the four Elements, return into Salt: for if a Body putrefie, what remains but powder and aſhes covering moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Salt? and if a Body be deſtroyed by combuſtion, calcination or incineration, what reſts in the laſt extraction but Salt? Glaſs-makers do give manifeſt teſtimony hereto: whence <hi>Arnoldus de villa nova,</hi> in his new Chymical Light, ſpeaking of the permanent Water of Philoſophers, which Water is dry, and wets the Tangents hand no more then common Quickſilver, ſaith, Who then can prepare this Water? Well, he may do it who can make Glaſs.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author, ſpeaking of the excellency of this dry Water, manifeſts it ſufficiently, when he ſaith in his Chymical Treatiſe, which he calls his <hi>Philoſophical Breviary,</hi> That an Operator can no more do any thing without Salt, then an Archer emit an Arrow without
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:174321:57"/>
a cord or ſtring. And <hi>Fons Amantium</hi> ſaith the ſame:

                        <l>Sans ſel ne peux metre en effect</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>All Bodies then are compoſed of Salt, and, as we ſaid before, the Principles of Compoſition and Reſolution are equal: which concurs with the Philoſophers infallible Rule, That the firſt matter of all things is one with the laſt: where they alledge Ice and Snow for example, which are by heat reſolved into Water; out of which, they were by cold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed. And if I ſhould here ſuggeſt the Teſtimony of all approved Authors to this Verity, my Treatiſe would end in a Volume: but that I may demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, That this Salt is pure and true Earth, (not ſuch as we tread upon, which I ſhall hereafter prove to be nothing but the Dregs and Excrements of the other) I muſt recur to the firſt Creation, which I ſhall decypher by a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:174321:58"/>
familiar example of an Operation made in imitation of Nature, and by the ſame Rule and Model by which this great Univerſe was framed.</p>
               <p>I ſaid before, That <hi>Water</hi> or the <hi>humid Nature,</hi> as <hi>Hermes</hi> calls it, upon which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the Spirit of the Lord moved,</hi> was the principle of all things.</p>
               <p>And here the Queſtion will be, How that great and confuſed heap of Waters was ſo divided, that this ample and groſs Terreſtrial Maſs proceeded thence; and by what medium ſo different things were procreated of the Earth?</p>
               <p>I ſhall anſwer to theſe Queſtions onely what experience hath taught me: It is therefore naturally probable, that in the middle of theſe Waters, by way of ſeparation, there was a certain col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſediments or ſetlings; wherein I follow the Text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſaith, That <hi>God ſeparated the water from the water:</hi> for there are two kindes of Waters, to wit, elevative and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelative Waters: the former then elevating it ſelf in a vapour, left the other fixed in the botom; as thoſe that coct Sea or Fountain-Salt daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:174321:58"/>
though perhaps it be be true, that the one is made by the attraction of the Suns Rayes, the other by the expulſion of Fire. And here note, That Fire and Heat onely are indued with a ſeparative faculty, which they exert either by violent or natural motion. This ſeparation then was made by one of theſe wayes: and to what thing could <hi>Moſes</hi> better compare this Fire (which cannot be otherwiſe defined then the origine of Univerſal Light, of Animal heat and vital motion, which gives exiſtence to all things, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them in their being) then to the Spirit of the Lord?</p>
               <p>Let us again conſider Natures Salt in its Chaos, diffuſed, diſſolved, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focated in its Water; under what form will it then appear, or with what quality will it affect our guſt, but that of bitter Water? and this form and quality it would retain for ever, if it were not ſeparated: but as ſoon as this elevative Water feels the action of Fire, it begins to flie from it by vaporation; and ſo the collection is gradually diminiſhed, till onely a little heap of Salt be left in the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:174321:59"/>
bottom, which comes together as the Earth did in the firſt Chaos of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee the firſt operation of Fire, which is the production of Drineſs, that is, of Earth. But as this firſt Earth remained ſtill coagulated with its Excrements and Dregs by Fire; ſo this Salt, which is true Earth, retains its Excrements, though it ſeem pure, white, and full of light: for nothing is generated, nouriſhed and augmented, but it abjects its Recrements of the formation and ſeparation; whereof we ſhall elſewhere ſpeak. Now this Salt or dry Earth, thus coagulated and ſetled in the Water, drinks up all its humidity, and is by the continuation of heats action, ſpontaneouſly dried: preſerving all this while, its innate moiſture, by which it is never deſerted, and from which it hath its diſſolutive vertue. After the acceſſion of this moiſt and dry temperament, it is apt for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, as the action of Fire ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel it from potency to effect: and as the Body of this great Earth hath the ſpecifical and productive vertue of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:174321:59"/>
ſo hath that ſame we call Salt: not that it can produce Herbs, Metals or Animals, as the other doth; but that it conſerves in its breſt the original Seed of all things, as Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the operations of Fire, manifeſts, hereby giving colours, ſapours, vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and induration to all theſe kindes; and alſo proper Fire which the Sun hath introduced into it, whereby it enlivens and nouriſhes all things: which I have ſometimes obſerved in the proſecution of a Philoſophical operation, whilſt I ſaw in this matter, without other mixtion, all colours diſtinctly one after another in order, and according to the internals that the Maſters of this Art determine, as they ſhould be in the matter and confection of the Philoſophers Stone; together with that ſudden fuſion which follows upon the attainment of the higheſt redneſs, like that of wilde Poppy: but it would not produce that admirable effect in changing of Metals; but it exerted ſuch miraculous vertues, by cauſing univerſal and natural ſweats in Man's Body, that I am afraid to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them, leſt I be branded with the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:174321:60"/>
title of a <hi>Scharlatane Medicaster,</hi> though <hi>C.V.</hi> my Soveraign good Prince, as an irreprehenſible Eye-Witneſs, may eaſily vindicate me from that injury: for when the fame of thoſe admirable cures came to his Ears, he was pleaſed, like a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to viſit the Habitation of his poor <hi>Philemon;</hi> induced thereto, I ſuppoſe, by the generoſity of his minde, and the relation of a good Man, who was ſo afflicted with divers Dolours, and extenuated with the diuturnity of his grievous Diſeaſes, that nothing but hopes on Divine Providence, or the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of his imminent Death, could move in him reſentment. The true relation, I ſay, of this Man, ſo much affected <hi>C. V.</hi> that he diligently took the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many men, whom I had by this remedy reſtored to ſanity: and if the covetouſneſs or envy of the Man who undertook the cure of the reverend Cardinal, and my Lord's Brother <hi>P. M.</hi> had not prohibited the uſe of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament; I perſwade my ſelf, by God's Grace and Benediction, it would have conduced to the ſanity of many that ſtill lie languiſhing for want of cures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:174321:60"/>If therefore this Salt have all the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Earth in it, who will deny it to be Earth; or ſay, That it may not be called the Univerſal Spirit made into Earth, as <hi>Hermes</hi> deſcribes it? But I aver, That this converſion cannot be effected, ſave by the Artifice of eaſie practiſe, but difficult perquiſition: for it is without falſity, an act exceeding Man's cogitations, to render that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter viſible to the eyes, and tangible to hands, which ſo many learned and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Writers in all ages have thought inviſible and incomprehenſible; of which they have affirmed, That thoſe that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in this profound Theory, may be able to diſcourſe well and plauſibly of its excellency; but ſhould never finde and know it in effect.

               </p>
               <p>The End therefore of the Heavens motion, is not onely to acquire new places, but to influence upon inferiour Bodies: for if any one ſhould imagine, that theſe influences are of no uſe, or that they are caſt into a place where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can receive them, he is in an error too groſs to be refuted.</p>
               <p>This Celeſtial Influx is perpetual and continual, becauſe the motion by which it deſcends, is orbicular; beginning in, and returning to it ſelf. And this is the Reaſon why the things whereon it influences, and which it produces, are of the ſame Nature and quality, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ceaſing to receive the power and multiplication of theſe Vertues which fail not.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing this Influence is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended above the Heavens, where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is, it muſt needs be carried toward ſome inferiour thing, that it may act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for nothing is paſſive but what hath a Body; and what other natural Body
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:174321:62"/>
is there in the World, but Earth? Is not this the Body of Bodies, and that ſolely that can ſubſiſt alone, having in it ſelf all the qualities requiſite to a Body, as Longitude, Latitude, Profundity and Superficies? Is not it the Subject and Mark that Nature hath ſet, whereat to aim all her Darts? where can ſhe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter accompliſh her works, then on the Earth?</p>
               <p>The Earth therefore is onely that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Body that receives Celeſtial In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, whoſe faculties and powers, penetrate, calefie, purge, ſeparate, enliven, augment, confer, and reſtore.</p>
               <p>We need not now diſpute, whether the Heavens and Celeſtial Bodies influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the Earth: for experience and ſenſe takes away this doubt. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being left as ſufficiently known, we ſhall onely declare how they make their influences vertuous. I ſaid before, That they tend directly downwards, and not upwards; and the Earth being the Centre of this Spherical Body, they muſt needs fall upon her, and faſten their Points there; for the Earth is that Point of the vaſt World, where all the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:174321:62"/>
lives of theſe influences concentricate. And ſeeing the Earth is a Body ſo ſolid, that it gives ſolidity to all others, it is requiſite that that which penetrates it be very ſubtile. The Heavens therefore being of moſt ſubtile matter, produce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like effects: for the operations ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily follow the qualities of the Body that operates. And this penetration would profit nothing, but like a Torrent running over a Field, becauſe of its ſwift motion, ſcarce wet the ſurface, unleſs it be by ſomewhat ſtayed. But ſeeing it tends infallibly to the Centre, and there is ſtopped, becauſe there is no lower place whereto it may deſcend; there it is compelled to ſubſiſt and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Hence ſome have ſaid, That the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of the Earth is moſt precious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in it all the influences are united; which meeting there, have an infinite potency, not onely becauſe they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually flow thither, but becauſe they proceed from Bodies infinite, incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and indeficient in vertue.</p>
               <p>The ancient Poets, who involved their Conceits in Fables, divide the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:174321:63"/>
Earth into three parts; aſſigning the Heaven to <hi>Jupiter</hi> as firſt-born of <hi>Saturn,</hi> (though ſome attribute the primogeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture 's right to <hi>Neptune,</hi> and the election of the ſuperiour Kingdom to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> for certain Sophiſtical Reaſons impertinent to my purpoſe:) <hi>Neptune</hi> they make the Lord of the Sea; and that by lot: To <hi>Pluto,</hi> as the youngeſt Son, they aſſign the Earth for Heritage, who is yet thought the richeſt of the three Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, becauſe in his Dominion all the Treaſures of the World are contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea, he ſeems to make his two Brothers Tributaries in thoſe things they poſſeſs as beſt. This Son they call, The King of Hell, and to him they give the Elyſian Fields, as a delightful place, where the bleſſed Souls ſhall follow his Court after death.</p>
               <p>Divines alſo aſſert, That Hell and the torture of Souls is in this place; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by this Argument: That ſeeing the Nature of the Stars is fiery, and all their influences concur, there muſt needs be incredible burnings there. Again, That place is infernal, becauſe none is more inferiour. But that Souls ſhould be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:174321:63"/>
here tormented, and that the heat of this place ſhould be ſo vehement as they ſay, is a Solaeciſm in Reaſon, and a Contradiction to Philoſophical Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis: for beſides that Souls poſſeſſe no place, according to their own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that being deveſted of the earthy part, and corporeal priſon, they would naturally elevate themſelves, and aſcend by vertue of their ſpiritual levity, which participates more of a fiery then any other quality; they cannot, but with violence, be detained in this ſubterraneous place, ſeeing they are light; nor yet, being ſimple, ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the action of Fire, which cannot act on its like.</p>
               <p>Why therefore they ſhould aſſert, That they deſcend to this place to be tormented, I ſee no reaſon, unleſs that the burthen of their ſins, wherewith they are implicated, ſhould detrude and depreſs them, compelling and forcing them to the Centre of the Earth, or elſe that ſin hath got them under its Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and hath incorporated it ſelf therewith, by ſome unknown kinde of compoſition, and ſo make them paſſible
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:174321:64"/>
and ſubject, not to the ſimple and natural action of Fire, but to ſome other vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent created one, deſtined by God to that effect: and perhaps the vertue of the Fire we ſpeak of, is by divine Power doubled for this action; which may be proved by Holy Writ.</p>
               <p>But I will not raſhly cheriſh any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Opinion, or ſeparate my ſelf from the Orthodox Faith; in the defence whereof, I will not onely ſpend my Life, but Induſtry, by God's aſſiſtance: yet I ſay in my Tranſient, (that I may further recede from my intended Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe) That they conclude ſtrangely, that ſay, Vehement burnings ariſe in this place, becauſe the influences of the Stars concur there: whereunto I would yet yield, if they can evince, That the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> conſerve and nouriſh: for if it were ſuch as they imagine, not onely the Earth but the whole Univerſe had been long ſince burnt to aſhes. Thoſe influence indeed in old <hi>Demogorgon</hi>'s bowels calefie; but not with a mortal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive, but with a vital heat, which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:174321:64"/>
there implants an uniform Vertue; which by mediation of heat, dilates it ſelf through the whole Body of the Earth, being the firſt moving cauſe of Generations.</p>
               <p>But we muſt not here conceive, That it is onely the external heat that comes from the Sun, which calefies the Earth, and cauſes Generation: for in Winter-time, when the Sun is furtheſt diſtant, the Earth hath abundance of heat in it, as experience ſhews, in Fountains, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns, and profound Cells: ſo that in the coldeſt Winter-Seaſon, Metals are cocted and indurated; yea, it is credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they are then moſt of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed, becauſe the heat of the Centre is kept in and retained, becauſe of the frigidity of the ambient Air. The Suns approach, and more perpendicular Aſpect, is not the ſole cauſe of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Spring; for if ſo, then doubtleſs, as its Aſcent were more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime, Vegetations would augment more proportionably to the encreaſe of the heat of the Rayes: but the contrary is obſerved. But becauſe every like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts its like; and the receſs of the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:174321:65"/>
one, cauſes the receſs of the other; The Sun by the magnetical Vertue of its Rayes, attracts and revokes the heat of the Central Sun, detruded by the rigid cold of the ambient into the interiour parts of the Earth: which returning to the ſurface thereof, affects all things with a vegetative faculty.</p>
               <p>It is not therefore the external heat of the Celeſtial Sun, but rather the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heat of the Central Sun, that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefies the profundity of the Earth: for heat is twofold; the one acts by rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, which is external; the other by influx and penetration, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, whereof I now ſpeak; whoſe Nature is to enliven, augment, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by the ſuſtentation of radical moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture contained in this Fire, which I made mention of in the precedent Chapter.</p>
               <p>But that now we may prove this Central Fire not to be ſo intenſe, as to torment and burn, let us conſider how the Stars do not by their influences cauſe heat ſolely, but work other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: for <hi>Saturn</hi> is cold and dry, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> hot and moiſt, the <hi>Sun</hi> hot and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:174321:65"/>
dry, <hi>Mars</hi> hot and dry, <hi>Venus</hi> cold and moiſt, the <hi>Moon</hi> moiſt and cold, and <hi>Mercury</hi> all in all, participating of all qualities alike.</p>
               <p>Whence we may gather, That all the influences are temperate, equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of heat, cold, moiſture and ſicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which thus meeting in moderation, cannot make the place where they meet, immoderate. The Vapour then or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that comes from the Centre, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates of theſe four: and hence all the qualities of ſimples have their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; whereof ſome calefie, becauſe in them heat is predominant; others dry, becauſe ſiccity ſuperabounds; others moiſten or refrigerate, according to the degree of their moiſture or cold: but on the other ſide. Stars project many other qualities beſides theſe, into the Centre: for they give Beings to thoſe ſapours, colours, and odours, which we taſte, ſee, and feel in ſublunary things. I ſay therefore, That the Stars calefie the Centre of the Earth, and that the Univerſal Spirit dwelling there, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates of this heat; and becauſe it is natural to heat to ſeparate, that ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:174321:66"/>
vertue which divides the pure from the impure, the ſubtile from the groſs, and the light from the heavy, and the ſweet from the bitter, deſcends with theſe influences: which purgative ſeparation, is the cauſe why all things naturally reject their Excrements, as not being of their ſubſtantial parts; which is indeed very requiſite, ſeeing there is nothing in the World, but its Excrements, exceed its natural ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: nay, all that we ſee and touch, is onely the excremental part of things, that obumbrates their occult ſubſtance; as we may obſerve in our Aliments, whoſe greater Maſs turns not into our ſubſtance, but goes away by the paſſages deſtined for ſuch egreſs; Nature onely extracting the inviſible and ſpiritual ſucce out of them, which is apt to be converted into ourfleſh and ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>We may likewiſe affirm, That this Maſs of Earth we tread upon, is nothing but the Excrement of that firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which was united in the Chaos; Now encompaſſing the Centre, and ſo including it in a Spherical, Equilibrial proportion, that it cannot move or fall:
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:174321:66"/>
for ſeeing it is in the loweſt of places, it can tend no wayes further, unleſs it ſhould aſcend; which is repugnant to its Nature. But in the mean while, I do not ſay, That the Body of the Earth is nothing but an Excrement: for though it appear wholly excrementitious, yet there lies under its Excrements, a pure ſubſtance; which being wholly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, could not become ſenſible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the adminiſtration of ſome Body; as we ſee in all things produced: their Seed and firſt Matter is inviſible; but as they are carried in a corporal Maſs, and excrementitious ſubſtance, we can ſee them; and no Body can be made without Excrements: for which cauſe, this ſubſtance is ſeparated from the Body of Earth in Generations, by the influence of Celeſtial heat; retaining nothing of the ſaid Earth, but as much as may be for a ſuſtentacle for it; which from the beginning had no other uſe, but to ſerve for a Receptacle and Shop, or rather a Veſſel, wherein this ſpiritual Matter might effect its operations; as we ſhall largely and plainly demonſtrate in the ſequel Chapter, where I ſhall treat of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:174321:67"/>
Separation more largely.</p>
               <p>But Separation were to little purpoſe, if the things ſeparated ſhould remain without action: Natures ſcope in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, is to enliven and abandon Death, which comes from no other cauſe but ſuperabundance of Excrements ſuffocating the pure ſubſtance; but here I mean natural, not violent Death: but if the Seeds of things ſhould alwayes lie buried in this excrementitious Earth, nothing would be produced or receive Life: but the Celeſtial Vertue by its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal influence extracts them; and theſe being full of Vertue, dilate and promote themſelves into all and each ſeveral ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as their Nature and Compoſition require.</p>
               <p>Life then proceeds from Purification, which the Stars effect by their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, with which the augmentative and reſtorative faculties deſcend: for the Stars being in continual motion, they are continually occupied with action, and conſequently with vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, giving Life to Life; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without Conſervation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration: Conſervation they give,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:174321:67"/>
by ſuſtaining Life indeficiently; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, by reſtoring what the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of individuals conſume and ſpend. And this we may ſee manifeſtly in the firſt Matter incorporated; for being impregnated by Celeſtial Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, it is of it ſelf nouriſhed, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and augmented continually.</p>
               <p>And hence it is called a Dragon or Serpent that preys upon it ſelf, always regerminating; which, where-ever it be, it takes ſuch root, that the place ſhall never be quite deſtitute of it, though it be waſhed or burned; which is a certain token by which this firſt Matter may be known.</p>
               <p>Theſe then are the principal Vertues which the Spirit of the World hath, and will alwayes receive from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Influences, which produce great and admirable effects in all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>But here ſome may enquire, How that the firſt matter receiving ſuch pure and potent Influences from Heaven, comes to be conſpurcated: with ſo many vitious qualities; and how it retains them when it hath received them, ſeeing it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:174321:68"/>
is alwayes buſied in the actions of vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, augmentation, conſervation, and reſtauration: for if it ſeparate not, it will die; and if it augment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and reſtore not, it will diminiſh, periſh, and debilitate; which it never does.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I anſwer, That the Stars have a twofold influence; one natural, the other accidental: the natural was communicated to them in their firſt Creation; and it is that Government of the Univerſe, which <hi>Hermes</hi> ſpeaks of, whereby they keep it in its Being, by defending and preſerving it by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, from deſtruction and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; wherewith the Spirit of the Univerſe is continually enriched: which applies them to, and manifeſts them in all things whereto it gives encreaſe and ſubſtance: but the accidental Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Stars, is that which falls out preternaturally, by reaſon of their different Situations and Aſpects: and this is alwayes ſubject to mutation, and never remains equal: and this hath only power upon the effects of Matter, not upon the Matter it ſelf; for whatever
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:174321:68"/>
influence happen, though never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign, the Centre of the Earth intermits not its actions, but abſolves them as before, and produces Animals, Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and Minerals, as well as ever; and if mortifications ſometimes fall out from the malignity of ſome Aſpect, they onely touch the ſurface or excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious maſs of Bodies, and not the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſubſtance: and ſuch an accident is often changed; ſo that the influence ſometimes operates one thing, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the quite contrary: which the natural and principal influx never does. Whence we may conclude, That the firſt Matter, as it is ſimple of it ſelf, receives nothing but thoſe Celeſtial Vertues, which it alſo retains and keeps in its Terrification.</p>
               <p>But we muſt now declare, how it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains them, that we may make good that ſaying of <hi>Hermes,</hi> That its Vertue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains entire when it is converted into Earth, becauſe all the Celeſtial Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues deſcend and meet in the Centre of the Earth; which in their courſe, aim at nothing, but the information of the Matter, which is as it were the Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:174321:69"/>
of the ſupream Idea's.</p>
               <p>The ſame Matter being full of Forms, is diverſified not indeed actually, but potentially, into innumerable ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications: and ſo it is not properly a Body, but as it were a Body or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of a Body, whereunto it hath an Appetite, and by information moves to that end: and this motion it hath from the action of Celeſtial Fire, which I before called, The firſt Mover in the Chaos: which the old Poets, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi> and <hi>Heſiod,</hi> deſcribe under the Name of <hi>Love:</hi> And <hi>Ronſardus,</hi> ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And hence it ſo ſuddenly penetrates Bodies, enlivening them, and augmenting their vertues, by reſtoring and preſerving what is natural
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:174321:70"/>
in them, to wit, their radical moiſture, which by its fiery ſubtily, it purges and ſeparates from its Excrements that ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it. And that I may in a word ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all, this that moſt excellent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, which <hi>Siracides</hi> ſaith is extracted out of the Earth, and which no wiſe Man will deſpiſe, It is moreover that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Salt, whereto the Doctor of Doctors compared his Apoſtles, as to a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Treaſure, produced by the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: for he might as well have ſaid, You are Adamants, Rubies, Pearls, Gold or Silver of the Earth; but that he knew, That all theſe things, though admirable, contained nothing in them comparable to this general Salt, whereunto all the reſt owe the homage of their perfections. This Medicine operates like Fire, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming the impure, which, as heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, it diſgregates from the homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous parts of the pure ſubſtance: and ſeeing the Heaven generated this Virgin in the bowels of the Earth, why ſhould ſhe not retain her Parents vertues; and like an Infant that naturally participates of both Paternal and Maternal Seeds, hold both Paternal and Maternal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours?

                  <hi>CHAP. 3.</hi> Of the Separation of Fire from Water, ſubtile from thick; and with what induſtry it ſhould be effected.</head>
               <p>NAture, the moſt ſagacious Agent, ſhews us by her proper operations, that in all things we muſt firſt conſider the end for which we undertake any matter, and then finde out means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the end. A prudent Searcher of Natures ſecrets then ſhould have perfect knowledge of the principles, progreſs, and qualities of matter, both internal and external, leſt in his ſearch he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found his end with his means: and forſaking the high-way which Nature hath trodden from the Foundation of the World, turn into by-paths, and phantaſtical unknown and unfrequented tracts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hermes</hi> knew the right way well; for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:174321:71"/>
he was indued with the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Worlds conſtitution; who, deſirous by Art to follow the footſteps of Nature, prudently imagined, That the Earth was the principle of all things, and the firſt Creature that was by Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration created in the belly of the Chaos; and thence he made ſuch ingreſs into the Treaſury of Natures Secrets by the Terrification of this firſt Matter, which I ſaid before was nouriſhed in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix of the Earth. But as it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a Builder to have Materials wherewithal to erect an Edifice, unleſs he know the manner of performing and fitting his Materials to the work: ſo <hi>Hermes</hi> was not content to finde out convenient matter, but made diligent ſearch for the manner whereby he might proſecute his work in imitation of the chief Operator in the Creation of the Univerſe, and ſo form a little World, wherein all the vertues of the greater World were included. Conſidering therefore, That the thing he purpoſed to make, muſt be moſt, and that he muſt begin with groſs and inferiour things to obtain this perfection; he firſt begun
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:174321:72"/>
to divide the contrary Natures, by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the ſuperfluous and uſeleſs parts, to avoid the ruine of his work: where, according to the Adage, it may be truely ſaid, <hi>He took the Bird by its Feet:</hi> and ſo going through the right Gate, entred into the Cloſet of Natures Secret, without turning: for Separation is the beginning of all things, and the firſt operation of the Univerſal Body; ſegregating the confuſed Members: by the diviſion of the confuſed Maſs or Chaos, the order and form of Elements firſt appeared, and took their places: for without Separation, Day and Night, Sun and Moon, Winter and Summer, had yet been one; Metals and Minerals, though never ſo different, would have been contained in one Body; and all Vegetables would have been but one Seed.</p>
               <p>It was therefore neceſſary, That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for the attainment of that Order and Diſtinction, wherewith we ſee the Univerſe condecorated, ſhould begin with Separation. But that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to particulars, let us ſee how this ſagacious Agent begins all her opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:174321:72"/>
but for Separation, Generation would neither have beginning nor end: by ſeparation, Aliments augment and conſerve every Body. And if I ſhould deduce the proof of this Argument thorow every ſpecies, I ſhould without doubt confound my ſelf in the intricacy of this <hi>Chaos,</hi> and never finde exiture, for the infinity of examples: I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay down this for a Foundation, <hi>That Nature begins all her Actions from Separation.</hi> But becauſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this is not ſufficient, unleſs withal we know what things ſhe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and whence this ſeparative faculty proceeds, we muſt diſcuſs this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more exactly, that our diſcourſe may proceed regularly: and before I meddle with any diſpoſition, I think it beſt to propoſe ſome definition of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and declare of how many kindes this Separation is.</p>
               <p>Separation then in general, is nothing but the diviſion and diſtinction of things diſſimilar from one another; as of the Heaven from the Earth, Sun from Moon, and the like; as alſo of the pure from the impure, heat from cold, dry from
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:174321:73"/>
moiſt, and the contrary. And from this Definition, we may draw two ſorts of Separation;</p>
               <p>The one of things differing onely ſimply, and not of contraries, as of the parts of the World which were ſeparated at firſt from the Chaos; or that we may deſcend to particulars, as of the Wood from the Bark; of Leaves from Fruits, and Roots from Boughs: and this ſpecies of Separation may be called ſimply a Diſtinction: for theſe parts are not really divided or ſeparated from each other, whether we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the principal or to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular members of the World: for though Heaven and Earth ſeem to be ſeparated from each other in ſituation, by reaſon of ſuperiority and inferiority; yet they are not divided one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeeing there is a perpetual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and affinity betwixt them: as appears by many places of this Book. Whence alſo <hi>Homer,</hi> no leſs Philoſopher then Poet, ſaid, That the Earth was bound to Heaven by a golden Chain. But that I may keep to my former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Leaves and Fruits, Wood and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:174321:73"/>
Bark, Boughs and Roots, are not ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and divided as contraries; but onely diſtinguiſhed by their proper places and garniſhments, whilſt they have a certain affinity and mutual tie; yet ſo, that the one does not occupy the others place, but that they agree toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſupport each other.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſpecies of Separation, is the Solution or Diſtraction of things totally differing, contrary, or ſuperfluous, which have no natural connexion with the ſubſtance of things; as pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, hot and cold, groſs and ſubtile, and the like: not that I would affirm, That theſe things cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but, That their union and mixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe of their diverſity, cauſes Deſtruction, or at leaſt hinders the action of the natural Vertue of the pure ſubſtance. And this kinde of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be properly called deciſion or diviſion, which Nature uſes in all her productions, that ſhe may ſet the proper actions and vertues of every thing at liberty.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſpecies is onely the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of parts truely diſſimilar in ſituation
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:174321:74"/>
and figure, but homogeneous in vertue and ſubſtance: for it is certain, That the Wood, Bark, and all the parts of a Tree, participate of one innate Vertue, which is particularly proper to the Tree, generally common to all its parts: but as to ſubalternate parts, there may be ſome difference; for ſome may receive more or leſs of the ſubſtance or vertue; but none contrary: for one and the ſame effect produces not things diametrically oppoſite, out of the ſame matter: a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary Plant emits no poyſonous facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. yet that may be ſalutary to one Body, that's mortal to another. Thus Hellebore nouriſhes Quails, but kills Men. But one Plant cannot exerciſe contrary Powers upon one and the ſame ſubject: for Hellebore cannot both nouriſh and kill Quails, nor both intoxicate and nouriſh Man. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vertue of the Plant then, is in the whole Plant; and any part of the Plant may be diſſimilar to another in ſituation and figure, but not contrary in vertue and ſubſtance: for the Leaves and Fruits have of the ſame ſubſtance and vertue, though one more then another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:174321:74"/>Here ſome may object, That Braſſica produces different effects: for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the vulgar opinion, its decoction looſes the belly, but its pulpe bindes the ſame.</p>
               <p>Whereto I anſwer, If it be proper for the ſubſtance of this Plant to looſe, it's impoſſible that it ſhould alſo binde; for to ſpeak plainly, the pulpe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains after decoction, is not of the ſubſtance of the Plant, as it appears by the concoction of the ſtomack, which receives the ſubſtance of Braſſica for Aliment, but rejects its pulpe, as an Excrement that hath no nutritive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in it; which faculty is wholly in the ſubſtance, and in each part of the ſubſtance: for the ſubſtance hath this propriety, That it admits of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but onely of more or leſs; which we muſt alſo underſtand of its actions and power, and not of its eſſence; of which we have an example: in man, no one part is more the part of a Man then another, though it may be greater, or more potent in vertue and action: the ſame may be ſeen in ſimples or Plants; wherein ſome parts are more or leſs
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:174321:75"/>
hot or cold, moiſt or dry, as their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours and ſapours manifeſt; yet are they not contraries; for one part of a Plant cannot kill through cold, and another of the ſame, kill through heat; but Experience ſhews us thus much, That the ſummities of Boughs, and that Flowers are more ſubtile in their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, then the trunks and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our parts of the ſame, becauſe it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in every ſubſtance, for the more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and pure parts to aſcend, and the impure to ſettle and abide next the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements: which Nature obſerves for two Reaſons: firſt, That ſhe may adorn the Plant; and by the variety of its digeſtion, make it grateful to look to. Secondly, That ſhe may adminiſter to Man or other Animals, what is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the conſervation of his eſſence, in a greater or leſs degree: herein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a careful and provident Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who prepares all things neceſſary and convenient, each thing in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as induſtry or poſſibility can render it: for ſhe never exceeds ſimple per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; and Flowers and Seeds are the moſt perfect parts in Herbs, which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:174321:75"/>
ſhe hath elaborated: which Art begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning where Nature left, may bring to a higher perfection, by the ſame way that Nature kept, to wit, by Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as we ſhall hereafter further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
               <p>Nature therefore by this firſt kinde of Separation, does nothing but diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh things, for the ornament of their ſubject, and uſe of Man, other Animals, or ſome part of the World, amongſt which ſhe hath ſown and implanted mutual Love, and Reciprocal Affinity; ſo that all things do naturally, and out of a kinde of ſympathy, tend to one anothers ſuccour and ſervice.</p>
               <p>But the ſecond kinde of Separation is different; for by it, Nature, or Art, in imitation of Nature, divides and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregates contraries; that is, abſtracts from the ſubſtance, what is not of its eſſence, but rather averſe to it; dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with it, though it be not of it; as pure with an impure thing, ſubtile with groſs, ſubſtance with its Excrements. And this ſecond kinde of Separation is uſed as the former, for two Reaſons alſo: one is, That, the pure ſubſtance be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:174321:76"/>
from corruption and death: the other is, that it may more freely exerciſe its vertues and actions, as being free from its groſs dregs: for when that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, poſſeſſes and contains that which is ſubſtantially pure, it never ceaſes to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it, till it hath quite vanquiſhed and ſuffocated it, and by that means made way for mortal corruption; which never approaches near ſimple and pure things, but haunts all fowl and impure ones. Now every ſubſtance is of it ſelf ſimple and pure, and by conſequence not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to corruption and death; as we may obſerve in all ſuperiour things, which are free from Excrements, but inferiour Bodies are otherwiſe; for they lie in the midſt of the impure Excrements of this World, which naturally deſtroy and mortifie their Gueſts, whereas purity enlivens and conſerves: corruptions and mortifications ſurround men, becauſe of the multitude of Dregs and Excrements they are infeſted with, which make them live a ſhort and miſerable life, as loaden with Aerumnies and Diſeaſes; ſo that they are here detained as a guilty Malefactor in an obſcure filthy Priſon,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:174321:76"/>
who being dubious betwixt death and hope of Life, lies there obduced with moldineſs, infeſted with vermine, and nouriſhed with immund and corrupt meats: for all Aliments are impure, and carry with them an Executioner, to wit, hidden poyſon: whence we at length, take our own death in our own hands, and ſpontaneouſly kill our ſelves, ſeeing our Aliments have ſo little of enlivening and nouriſhing vertue in them, and that ſo cloſely enveloped with Excrements, that the digeſtion of the ſtomack, though ſtrong, can ſcarce attract it: now we eating ſuch meats, do ingeſt poyſon with the good ſubſtance; which entring our Bodies, ceaſes not to be augmented and accumulated; till it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and extinguiſh the vital Light, or rather Natures legitimate Action, which is Vivification, unleſs ſome Medicine or Separation retard or ſuſpend it.</p>
               <p>Corruption then is induced by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements; and it may happen two ways: either from the Parents Seed, who being not well, and by conſequence corrupt, produce corrupt Seed; dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating more from Generation to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:174321:77"/>
but this is ſo far ſubject to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Corruption, as that by help there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the courſe of its activity towards Mortification may be ſtayed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded.</p>
               <p>This Corruption may not improperly be called that Malevolent Satan, who goes about continually ſeeking whom he may devour: for which cauſe, this wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders about the Terreſtrial Globe or the Excrements of the World, which have their principal ſeat on the Earth, which alſo eructate their Corruption upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elements: and thus Men living of them and in them, are corrupted in them and by them; and ſo they produce corrupt Seed, which time renders more and more corrupt: for our age being more vitious and diſſolute then that of our Anceſtors, hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered us worſe then they; and the next its probable will be worſe then us, and the next more diſſolute ſtill.</p>
               <p>The ſecond riſe of Corruption is from the continual uſe of too too excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Aliments, by which our Bodies are depraved; ſo that this infection will paſs from the Parent to the Son, as we ſee
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:174321:77"/>
in the Leproſie and other hereditary Diſeaſes. Now theſe Aliments deduce their Corruption from the place where they are generated: for after the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Creator had diſpoſed the confus'd Chaos, he ſo ordered, that the ſuperiour Bodies ſhould remain pure and ſubtile, but the inferiour groſs and impure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the Nature of pure ſubſtances to aſcend to the place of their origine, but of Excrements to deſcend to the Centre.</p>
               <p>And hence it is, That that which is pure in Animals and Vegetables, is elevated and aſcends higheſt, and makes them aſcend &amp; increaſe with it, till it be freed from the Excrementitious Maſs, which ſubjects it to mortal Corruption, and that it may attain the place that is remoteſt from Excrements, and live without alteration or ſpot; for the ſame cauſe alſo more ſpiritual and ſubtile Creatures inhabit in higher places, as being purer, and finding their Aliments more convenient, and like their natural ſubſtance: but ſuch as are coporal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit lower places, where they are immerged in dregs and filth, that have
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:174321:78"/>
their place in lower parts; whence they are corrupted by that of which they live, which is mixed with mundane Dregs: for whatever the Earth and other Elements (which are the Receptacles of impurities) can produce, is corrupt and maculated; and therefore induces corruption and defilement upon all Bodies that uſe it for Aliment: And thus Blood acquires an ill diſpoſition, which afterwards beget ill humours; but in ſome more, in others leſs; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inquinated ſtate of the Parents, and the abuſe of the corruptive things, which cauſe mortality and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: for if the Earth and the Fruits thereof were as pure as the Heavens, all Animals would live as long as the Celeſtial Incoliſts: But Nature hath ordained this for a Law, That that partakes more of corporeity, ſhould dwell about that that's moſt corporeal; and that which is more corruptible and inquinated, about that that's likeſt to it: but the Earth is loweſt of Bodies; and therefore moſt groſs and corruptible. Nothing therefore can proceed from it, but what is like it; unleſs its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:174321:78"/>
and impurity be ſtayed by the Art of Separation, and all its pure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance extracted from its Body; which a true Philoſopher may by induſtry ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>It never was, nor yet is, my intent to offend Phyſitians, to whom I owe much honour; yet I, with many learned men, admire, they do not better inſtruct A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries, that they may be more curious in preparing Medicaments; whilſt themſelves may obſerve how oft they have been fruſtrated in ſucceſs, when they proceed after the vulgar manner: for they will cure and reſtore ſick and weak Bodies, by offering them a great deal of Pottage; wherein there is yet ſo much impurities and groſs dregs, that very little pure ſubſtance, wherein the curative faculty conſiſts, remains; which is ſo immerged in their Poyſon, that they have no power againſt the Diſeaſe: neither can Nature help their operation; for ſhe is ſubdued in this conflict, by the impurity of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on the one ſide, and the cauſe of the Diſeaſe on another: which is all one, as if a Man ſhould drive away Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:174321:79"/>
by corrupted &amp; corrupting means; which is impoſſible: for Rain never dries up Rivers, nor Fire extinguiſh a Flame; nor yet Corruption expel Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. They alſo attempt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration of their Patients debilitated ſtrength, by Aliments of eaſie digeſtion, which they think partake of little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, and ſo are not ſubject to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: never conſidering, That this way cannot much profit them; for though they uſe very choiſe Aliments, yet are they not of much advantage, becauſe they are indued with no action or power that can either exterminate or leſſen the morbifical cauſes, but onely refulciate their miſerable lives, almoſt ruined by weakneſs; never freeing them from death, unleſs that Nature ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneouſly ariſe and oppoſe the mortal Machinations of her Enemies, or elſe the Patient ſeek help from ſome exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Medicament, brought by ſome pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Artificers induſtry to ſupernatural purity and perfection; which being free from Corruption, may reſtore the priſtine vigour, and by this means, eradicate the cauſe of the Diſeaſe: for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:174321:79"/>
every true Medicament ſhould effect two operations, to wit, purge from Corruption, and reſtore loſt Strength; and in this the whole Baſis and Art of Medicine conſiſts, though the leſſer of the two parts is onely in uſe, to wit, Purgation; the more excellent, to wit, Reſtauration, being wholly aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or through ſloath or avarice ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected.</p>
               <p>And that theſe things are thus carried, is apparent from certain Potions intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, which have no other effect, but onely to make the Belly laxative, or purge out not that matter that cauſes the Diſeaſe, but ſome other Excrement, that hath nothing to do with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; or elſe through the ill preparation, diſpenſation, or impertinent adaptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſimples, cauſe ſuperfluous evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, to the ruine of Nature, too weak before, but now more enervated, both by reaſon of vacuity, which it abhors above all things, and alſo by reaſon of violent motion cauſed by ſuch Purges.</p>
               <p>And thus they rather procure Death then Sanity; for Nature can no more
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:174321:80"/>
endure violent motion then vacuity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe is very impatient of theſe two her ſworn Enemies, which attempt ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently her deſtruction.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe, common Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine ſeldom cures obſtinate Diſeaſes by their Compoſitions, as they commonly prepare them: and if amongſt many, any one be cured, this happens not becauſe of Pills, Boles and Potions; but of the ſtrength of Nature, which is able to overcome the impure quantity mixed with theſe remedies, and extract ſomething out of their pure ſubſtance, commodious for its ſubſidy: or elſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the poyſonous quality of theſe excrementitious and corruptive things, is rejected and expelled by Nature; which is of that power, that it carries with it ſome portion of the peccant humour which is like to it, by attraction and ſympathy.</p>
               <p>And thus an extraneous Medicament, impugning the Body, moves Nature; which provoked and prepared to reſiſt this her Enemy, rejects and violently impugnes what is contrary to her. And now, if a Medicament ſhould always
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:174321:80"/>
be convenient, and not contrary to Nature, it ſhould be purged from its poyſon, that is, from its excrementitious Maſs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore a Medick ſhould firſt chuſe ſuch things, as are convenient for, and hold ſympathy with Man's Body; and free them from their impurities, or at leaſt chuſe ſuch as contain in them the general vertue, or innate purity; which Purification cannot be effected, till the impure and noxious be ſeparated and deſtroyed, and the pure reſtored, which lay buried and ſuffocated under the Excrements.</p>
               <p>But it being none of my Profeſſion to make Medicaments, I will not further treat of this buſineſs; but will return into the way whence I have a little ſwerved. I ſay therefore, Seeing there is no inferiour thing, but that's infected with Poyſon, immerged in Excrements, and buried in Dregs, that cauſe its mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, and hinder the liberty and action of its legitimate ſubſtance; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is conſtrained by a certain neceſſity, to make uſe of Separation; which is effected by diviſion of the pure from the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:174321:81"/>
impure, the ſubtile from the groſs, and the ſalutary from the deſtructive part. But becauſe this admirable Agent works her operations in darkneſs, labouring in bodies by a ſecret digeſtion, ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exceeds ſimple perfection; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to onely is her power extended: whence corporal Elements, being not able to conduce to the higheſt degree of their proprieties, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies wherein they are included; Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers prudently endeavour to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate their ſubſtance from their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptive Maſs: and after this Separation in Natures way, to wit, by Digeſtion and Sublimation, to carry them to the higheſt degree of purity; getting them by Regeneration a new form, taking away their former Nature, Qualities, and Proprieties, and changing their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Bodies into Spirits full of purity, their moiſture and cold into dryneſs and heat: practiſing and effecting this, not onely in ſome ſpecies or ſimples, but in the great Body of the World alſo, which is our Univerſal Spirit: for unleſs the Univerſal Nature of all things be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, it is impoſſible to bring it to a
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:174321:81"/>
ſtate of incorruption. Regeneration then is the firſt Fruits of Separation: but as a Grain can of it ſelf generate nothing unleſs it die and putrefie in the Earth, ſo it is impoſſible any thing ſhould be renewed or regenerated, ſave by precedent mortification.</p>
               <p>Mortification then is the firſt ſtep to Separation, and the onely tract to that end: for as long as Bodies remain in their old Corruption and origine, Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration cannot reach them, unleſs putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and mortification lead the way: which alſo our Lord Jeſus divinely taught, ſaying, Unleſs that a Man, like a Grain of Corn, die, he cannot acquite life incorruptible: not as if he meant that life incorruptible ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by death corporal; for then impious and wicked Men, by dying would attain Beatitude with the Good and Juſt: but he meant that the old Man ſhould die, that is, mortifie and ſeparate his old Corruption from him, which he attracted from the Seed of his firſt Parents.</p>
               <p>And this Corruption is properly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance and exceſs, introduced by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:174321:82"/>
the eating of the forbidden Fruit, by which Death entred the World; and ſince which, Man ceaſed not to die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe afterwards the Earth and all it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced were infected by the Poyſon of the fraudulent Serpent hidden in their Aliments, whoſe enticements led Man to tranſgreſſion, and to the eating of Fruit wherein death was included.</p>
               <p>And this corrupting Serpent is he that I call Satan, who creeping, and without ceaſing going about the Earth, mixes his Poyſon therewith, and with all things it produces, to wit, Animals, Vegetables and Minerals, with intent to infect the World with his Poyſon, and tyrannize over Man.</p>
               <p>Upon this intemperance and exceſs in diet, a privation of Vertue follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for Vice is nothing but a neglect of what is juſt, and juſtice is a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate deſire, and continual progreſs to good.</p>
               <p>This intemperance then and exceſs muſt die in us, becauſe it generates all kinde of ſin in us, and ſtimulates us to malice and impiety; and therefore we are injoyned to live ſoberly, and ſhun
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:174321:82"/>
gluttony and drunkenneſs, the true Authors of all carnal luſts: and that we faſt often, to extinguiſh thoſe internal flames, which move our Sences, and burn our Blood to Corruption.</p>
               <p>The Anatomiſts of Man, know, that Man is twofold; the one Celeſtial and immortal, the other Terreſtrial and corruptible: and the firſt is as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journer, the ſecond as a Priſoner.</p>
               <p>But here ariſes a great Queſtion, How it comes to paſs, that the heavenly Man can, whilſt buried in this putrid and corrupt Carkaſe, conſerve his eſſential purity? for it is manifeſt, That a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, though never ſo precious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, will loſe its ſapour and odour, if it be long contained in a ſtinking Veſſel: and Man alſo, though never ſo ſound, is ſubject to infection, if he dwell in a peſtilent Houſe: a heavenly Man is of himſelf good and ſincere; but as he is joyned to the Terreſtrial, to whom impurity and vices naturally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here, he can ſcarcely remain free from ſpots.</p>
               <p>The depravation of this eſſential purity, depends without doubt on the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:174321:83"/>
eating the forbidden Fruit; or to ſpeak more expreſly, on the intemperance of Aliments, condited with pernicious and contagious Corruption: for which cauſe, this intemperance &amp; corruption muſt be mortified, that the old Deſtroyer of Man may be reſtrained, &amp; that that may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by newneſs of life, which makes us like our heavenly Father in incorruption.</p>
               <p>And our Reſtorer Jeſus hath taught us two ways to Regeneration: one by the Water of Baptiſm, and the other by the Fire of the Holy Ghoſt. Water waſhes away the ſpots, and Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes and ſeparates all impurity from the pure eſſence: and as his precious Blood (which is true Water indeed) purges away our ſins, and ſaves us from that death, which the mortal corruption of our earthly Parent introduced; ſo Water diſſolves and purges away thoſe excrementitious impurities which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt all ſubſtances. The Fire of the Holy Spirit conſumes and ſeparates the excrementitious impurity of ſins, and ſo the vulgar Fire blots out the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of Bodies: which ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be mortified, that it may be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:174321:83"/>
and this Mortification is that Putrefaction and Digeſtion, which fits it to receive Separation; and this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is then wrought in us, when the Sun of the Holy Spirit riſes upon our Hearts, and warms our Centre, conſuming by little and little the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affections of old <hi>Adam.</hi> After the ſame manner, the Chymical Fire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberating its flame about the Body that is to be purged, burns and annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates that that is of an extraneous Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and that more or leſs, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity is more or leſs obſtinate to Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is effected by Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This then is the right way which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture obſerves in the Regeneration of all things; which will have no laudable effect in Medicine, unleſs they be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated by Water and Fire. But the ſame things after this ſecond Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity are moſt free in their vertues and actions; whereas before, their vital functions were buried in an excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Maſs: and though the benign influences of Heaven had given them much vertue, yet could not they exert
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:174321:84"/>
it: even ſo a Man, whilſt he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the impure Priſon of old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> he can produce no good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable action.</p>
               <p>But before I proceed further in the practical explication of theſe things, I muſt return to my begun-order, to wit, that after I have given the definition of Separation, and declared of how many kindes it is, that now I may ſhew what theſe kindes are, whence things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to be ſeparated, and whence this ſeparative vertue ariſes. And I have ſufficiently demonſtrated, That there are in Bodies two parts: the one is an Excrement, the other ſubſtance; the one accidental, and the other ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial: for ſubſtance ſimply conſidered, is wholly pure, and without Corruption; but an Excrement wholly impure, mixing it ſelf with the ſubſtance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminating and ſubverting its purity.</p>
               <p>The Generation and Formation of ſubſtance is ſufficiently detected in the two firſt Chapters of this Book: it now reſts that I explain the Nature and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Excrements: where I infer, from the aforeſaid Narration, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:174321:84"/>
but Excrements ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated; ſuppoſing this for undeniable, That amongſt paſſible things in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary World, nothing is void and free from Excrements: for when God ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the parts of the World, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, That ſome ſhould deſcend to the loweſt Region, as partaking of the groſneſs of the firſt matter, and that they ſhould there congregate amongſt themſelves: and of this feculent Maſs, the Earth was formed, which is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs indued with ſome part of pure ſubſtance, though diffuſed through its thick craſſitude: after that <hi>Phoebus</hi> had ſlain the monſtrous <hi>Python,</hi> ſwelled up with poyſonous humours, which was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated of the mud of the Earth; that is, when the innate ſiccity had imbibed the ſuperfluous humidity, by the operation of natural heat, the Earth begun to feel the actions of this ſubſtance included in its breſt: which ſubſtance is that ſpirituous matter which is never idle, but alwayes imployed about Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Vivifications; which may here be properly called the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the proper and vertuous ſubſtance
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:174321:85"/>
of the Earth, is that alone that by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per corporation generates all Bodies according to individual Idea's; as I have deſcribed it in this Ode, out of which I ſhall take what is convenient for my purpoſe.</p>

                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:174321:86"/>
what is as pure, nor impure over as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure. But Nature being always occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in ſeparating the pure from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, for the preſervation of its eſſence and vital encreaſe, hath this ſubſtance mixed with impurity, for its ſole ſubject; which, retaining the ſtate and Nature of its Creation, is not nouriſhed, multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or augmented, ſave with the nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, multiplication and accretion of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, which are not conſubſtantial with it, but onely Companions and Siſters of its nativity. And that theſe things are ſo, ſuch have experienced, who by Divine Inſpiration have found the way to extract this firſt matter, and to corporate it in imitation of Nature; which, whatever purity, cleanneſs, and clarity it ſeems to have, yet is it always loaden with a great quantity of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Dregs, which cannot be taken away without great induſtry.</p>
               <p>I think then, that I have by moſt valid Arguments demonſtrated, That every maſſy Body is not nouriſhed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the viſible Earth, but by ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous matter onely: whereby we ſee, that they very much abound with Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:174321:87"/>
and that their whole Maſs is nothing elſe but an Excrement, wherein this ſpirituous Matter, that's apt for corporation, lurks inviſibly: for though we eat and drink, yet all that ingredes our ſtomacks, goes out alomſt in the ſame quantity that we aſſumed it in. We do not therefore extract our vital Oyl out of its Maſs, but that pure eſſence and ſubſtance that lies within it.</p>
               <p>Briefly, That excrementitious part is nothing elſe but the houſe of this pure ſubſtance, and the vehicle that carries this nutritive Spirit to the place of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution, there to compleat its dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and requiſite Separation. Are not Trees and Plants incorporated with this maſs of Excrements? and is not this Maſs, the Conduit of their enlivening and vegetative Spirit, and as it were a fulciment that makes them grow? I do not ſay, That all that is in a Tree, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther individual, is wholly an Excrement; for in every thing, there inhabits ſome particle of this ſubſtance, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtly call a Body, but onely a thing apt for corporation, which Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not work of it ſelf: for though what we
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:174321:87"/>
ſee and touch is progenerated of matter apt for corporation; yet this Body is not ſubſtantial, and nothing but Excrement is ſeen. So that Nature ſuffers nothing of that to appear, that is the vital eſſence, ſubſtance or matter of the thing; but Art, which by induſtry ſuperates the ſimple power of Nature, can do it well enough: for an ingenious Naturaliſt conſiders this, That though the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous matter and ſubſtance of things be nowhere pure in natural Creation, yet being mixed with dregs, it may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by the digeſtion of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, which rejects Excrements, and retains the ſubſtance: not as if this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration were ſubject to ſight, but to the underſtanding by the appearance of the effect, whereby we finde the dregs and Excrements rejected as uſeleſs for the conſervation of the eſſence of a Body.</p>
               <p>Moreover, Augmentation, Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Vivification, coming to Bodies by this ſubſtance, aſcertain us of this thing, though Nature whereby it acts, hides the operation: the ſubſtance then being ſeparable, it muſt be innately pure
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:174321:88"/>
and homogeneous, or ſimilar in all its parts; but this purity cannot be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by Nature for her operations; for the intentional perfection of things is onely ſimple.</p>
               <p>But an Artiſt, obſerving that Heat is the onely Medium and Inſtrument which Nature uſes in the attainment of this perfection, and Fire the ſole Purger and Separator, tending to perfect puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: and further minding, that in the centre of every Body, ſome pure ſubſtance is contained, which can be naturally ſeparated, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, yet according to the extent of its faculties, he propoſes to himſelf the ſame way, and the ſame Inſtrument that Nature uſes, to wit, Fire; which he ſo adminiſters, as to deſtroy, burn or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the Excrements, without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the pure ſubſtance reſiding in the centre; which he continues, till it be perfectly pure, and the Fire have no further deſtructive power over it, but rather acts for its conſervation, exaltation, and the introduction of a Tincture and Quality like to it, and ſo at length convert this whole pure
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:174321:88"/>
ſubſtance into its own proper Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>An Artiſt then, minding this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to reſide in all things, and that all things may be burned; ſo that after combuſtion, Aſhes will remain, which the Fire cannot devour, he prudently concludes, That in thoſe Aſhes there remains ſomething not ſubject to the vigour of Fire and Flame. And further incumbent on his work, he findes a kinde of Salt, not produced by Fire, but rather the Victor over Fire, like the pure Gold of every burnt Body. This Salt is the laſt matter reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing in the Anatomy of Bodies, and not Aſhes; whence this Salt was ultimately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and out of which, nothing can be further extracted: for if by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity it be turned into Water, by heat it will be again congealed into Salt. Whence we may conclude, That this Water was <hi>Mercury,</hi> whence all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were firſt created; and that this Water, hidden in the aſhes, hinders their total conſumption by combuſtion, as the univerſal <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Bowel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:174321:89"/>Wherefore the learned <hi>Ronillaſcus</hi> in his Writings, calls this <hi>The Water of Mercurial Fire,</hi> becauſe Fire gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, nouriſhes it; yea, augments its goodneſs ſo much more, by how much it remains longer in it: for the ultimate operation of Fire is to make Salt; and Salt is nothing but dry Water, which acquires and conſerves its ſiccity by Fire, and thence it is of like Nature to it.</p>
               <p>And here I would not have any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, That in the beginning of this Book I ſaid, That Fire is not without Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; for ſeeing it is nouriſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, it muſt alſo participate thereof; becauſe all things take their nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from that whereof they are made. So that Fire and Moiſture are as it were two Correlates; the one whereof cannot exiſt without the other, no not in imagination: and the Elements have without doubt, ſuch affinity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion one with another, and ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate one of another, that any of them may be found in his aſſociate: for the <hi>Earth</hi> contains Air, Water and Fire; <hi>Water,</hi> Fire, Air and Earth; <hi>Air,</hi> Earth, Water and Fire; and <hi>Fire,</hi> Water, Air

               <p>From the Premiſes we may collect, That nothing is deſtitute of Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that Excrement and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance are the two conſtitutive parts of a Body; and that nothing but Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as accidental, and not affine to the eſſence or ſubſtance, ſhould be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. We may likewiſe gather, That Fire onely procures and facilitates this operation.</p>
               <p>But it is time that we proceed and ſhew how this may be done: for it is not enough to ſay, That Separation is the beginning of the works of Nature and Art, nor to know what things are ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſs the practiſe &amp; manner of this operation be alſo rendered intelligible. I ſaid before, That there were two kindes of Separation: one for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and Ornament, of which I will ſay no more, becauſe it appertains onely to Nature, not to Art: the other is made by Deciſion or Diviſion, which I ſhall now explicate. I ſaid before,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:174321:90"/>
That all things conſiſt of two parts; Excrement and Subſtance: Subſtance is of it ſelf ſimple and indiviſible, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we take it general for the firſt Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal matter, or in particular for any ſpecies, according to the impreſſion of the Celeſtial Idea, which is infinite. This Subſtance or firſt Matter in every ſpecies of compounded Bodies, is one in eſſence, vertue and quality: and in one and the ſame ſubject, one part can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of one ſpecies, and another of another: but in Excrements it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for the better underſtanding whereof, I will lay the following Rule, That there are but two means or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums for the compleating of all Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to wit, <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water:</hi> and there are but two things ſeparable in Bodies; the one whereof is ſeparated by Fire, the other by Water. In the firſt place it is indubitable, That the Nature of Fire is ſuch, as it deſtroyes and conſumes all that is combuſtible; and of Water ſuch, as it waſhes and cleanſes all ſubſtance from its impurity that commaculates it: Fire devours all that's volatile, and of an Airy quality, becauſe it is its proper nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:174321:90"/>
but Water divides all that's Terreſtrial and groſs. Betwixt theſe two extremes then, there muſt be ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate diſpoſition, which ſhould be kept and conſerved, containing nothing that's combuſtible or impure in it, which may be ſubjected to theſe two Warriers. And it is manifeſt, That Aduſtion and Dregs are the two Corrupters and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyers of all things; which Divine <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> was not ignorant of, when he ſaid, That all Diſeaſes proceed either from the Air or Aliments; inſinuating, that the exceſs of excrementitious Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are apt to receive corruption, and Excrements by Fire exceeding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural heat, are the inflaming and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting cauſes of each Diſeaſe: for the Excrements of Aliments, fill Bodies with Terreſtrial impurities, and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable Air generates ſulphureous and aduſt matter, which eaſily conceiving hot ardours, conſumes and diſſipates what is radical and vital with it ſelf; carrying it away, becauſe the greater part of it is volatile, the leſs aduſtive. Dregs then, and Aduſtion, are the two Authors of corruption, and thoſe that hinder
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:174321:91"/>
the vigour of ſubſtantial actions in all things.</p>
               <p>And if we require any Arguments to prove this, the ſtink of Digeſtion and Excrements demonſtrates it; for that ſame ſented in things that are burned, ſpeaks little of good to be there. The ſame is alſo evident in the fumes of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements which ſtinking Bodies emit; for thoſe ſuppoſe corruption; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the corruption they generate, they alſo cauſe theſe two inconveniences; the one is the hindrance of Penetration, the other of Fixation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which two acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are abſolutely neceſſary for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of life: for that which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes and ſupports life, muſt needs be ſubtile, that it may by its ſubtile parts penetrate Bodies, and like a ſecret Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, roborate and augment the light of life in the centre of the Body: for if it were groſs, it would rather obſtruct, ſuffocate and extinguiſh, then penetrate and paſs through ſuch narrow ways: and becauſe on the other ſide it conſerves life in its ſtate, it ſhould in reaſon be a ſtable, and no fluxible thing; for if it were volatile, we might every moment
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:174321:91"/>
expect death, leſt it ſhould be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the corruption generated by feculent aduſtion, which continually layes wait for our life. Groſneſs then, hinders Ingreſs, and Aduſtion, Stability.</p>
               <p>Hence we may take a good admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Medicine, to wit, that every true Medicament introſumed for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring of ſtrength, and profligating the cauſe of inſtant death, ſhould have two properties, to wit, to pierce to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of ſanity, and preſerve the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, by dilating and deducing it through the whole Body; which the Ancients, with good ſucceſs, revoked to practiſe; and not many yeers ago, the too much hated <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> who explained their operations to poſterity, which were ſo long kept ſecret; and let him that will, affirm the contrary, I doubt not to aver, That nothing without the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fire, can be brought to purity and ſtability; which two parts muſt be chiefly obſerved in making Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: to which Aſſertion this valid Reaſon draws me, That no body in its firſt original and form can be truely Medicinal, as immerged in the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:174321:92"/>
of its excrementitious Dregs, becauſe it cannot attain the place &amp; fear of ſanity, nor yet preſerve ſanity, becauſe it wants ſubtilty to penetrate, and fixedneſs requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Reſtauration of what is corrupt and loſt, and the conſervation of what is reſtored; which cannot poſſibly be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the common way of preparation, neither in ſubſtance, nor in infuſion: the impoſſibilty hereof in ſubſtance appears, in that ſuch do not purge without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which cauſes rather perilous weakneſs, then ſalutary Reſtauration: and as to infuſions, nothing can thereby be extracted out of ſimples, but a little introſity, which is innate in all Bodies, with a little of their excrementitious Dregs. Hence infuſion attracts not the internal vertue, but onely the external ſapour of things, which in their centre is quite different from that in their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial matter: for commonly we ſee, all infuſions are bitter; which we are forced to obdulcorate with Sugar or Honey, becauſe moſt Apothecaries are not ſo induſtrious, as to extract the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſweetneſs wherein the Nature of the things conſiſts, from the things they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:174321:92"/>
infuſe; for all bitterneſs proceeds from Salt, which hath ſweetneſs at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, which cannot be extracted by ſimple infuſions, but by Fire onely, and ingenious Artifice; this ſweetneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very perfection of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.</p>
               <p>Hence <hi>Arnoldus de villa nova</hi> ſaith, That if you know how to dulcorate what is bitter, you have the whole myſtery. Which <hi>Bruceſtus</hi> was not ignorant of, as appears by his Dialogue, entituled, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogorgon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this occult ſweetneſs can never be manifeſted, unleſs it be quite freed from Terreſtrial Excrements, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile and Aereal Aduſtion: for the earthineſs thereof, gives it its extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſapour ariſing from the Excrements of Salt, from whoſe variety, according to the ſpecies and place wherein they are generated, the diverſity of ſapours doth ariſe: for all ſapour comes from Salt; and by how much there is more Salt, by ſo much is the ſapour more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe. And on the other ſide, that which is volatile and Aery, begets ill and non-natural odours, which ſend out
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:174321:93"/>
a ſtinch, which we perceive in their burning, becauſe of the combuſtion and inflammation of the unctuous Sulphur: and that volatile matter is an Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is apparent from the ſtinking fumes of Bodies that are burning, whence ſmoak proceeds; that adhering to the Chimney or other part, which afterward retain the odour of the burnt Bodies, and the bitterneſs of the Excrements of Salt. And this is yet more manifeſt, by that blackneſs and obſcurity which this fume impreſſes on all things it touches, which greatly hinders the light and ſplendor of Nature, which always deſires purity and freedom from darkneſs, as appears by that intenſe ſplendor in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bodies, a token of their purity, ſeeing others, more immerged in impurity, are more obſcure; as Metals perfect and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, &amp; precious Stones, demonſtrate.</p>
               <p>But if we would avoid long peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and according to the oracles advice, terminate our curious journeys in our ſelves, by ſeeking out the cauſes of our Diſeaſes, we ſhould eaſily finde them derived from thoſe infected fumes that obſcure the light of our ſanity; and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:174321:93"/>
thence deſume a manifeſt ſign of what is wrought within us: for a ſound Man, becauſe of the internal clarity of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſpoſition, hath a cleer and lively coloured aſpect: but a ſick Man, from the firſt onſet of his diſeaſe, is pale and plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beous, his native vigour periſhing and decaying: and all theſe mutations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the fumes of ſulphureous and excrementitious Aduſtion and Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which extend themſelves tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all the members, and by mediation of the pores, infect the whole Body.</p>
               <p>This paleneſs may alſo proceed from Nature, feeling her ſelf aggravated with a diſeaſe, and thereupon revoking all the pure and good Blood inwards, that muſtring up their forces ſhe may better oppoſe her enemy, or ſuſtain his aſſaults: and upon this occaſion, the external parts are deſtitute of their clarity; and in this conflict the external parts remain as it were dead like Earth, &amp; tend to obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe Earth, wherein this battle is begun, is naturally black; as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Fire is by Nature clear and white.</p>
               <p>The Earth then on its part, being ſpiſſe and obſcure, begets blackneſs and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:174321:94"/>
ſulphureous, fuliginous, and ſmoaky A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtion, begets obſcurity; wherefore both cauſe corruption, deſtruction and ruine: and beſides theſe two, nothing in the world procures univerſal ruine; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is any inferiour Body exempted from theſe evils, ſave Gold and precious Stones, which Nature hath brought to what perfection ſhe can.</p>
               <p>And ſo Death is to other Bodies a perpetual enemy, ſeeking how to deſtroy them; but Nature, as a careful Mother, how to preſerve her works; who hath armed two potent and nimble Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions to help them, and withſtand the Adverſaries fury: one whereof is Fire, the expugner of ſulphureous Aduſtion; the other Water, the expeller and driver of Terreſtrial dregs. And as Nature is ingenious and ſubtile in all her opera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo is Art indued with equal ſubtilty and induſtry. And there's no other way to Separation inſtituted by Nature from the beginning, but theſe two, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her ſelf hath trodden from the non-age of the Univerſe, whoſe firſt ſeeds, void of form, and confuſedly mixed in a Chaos, were diſſolved in Water, and by
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:174321:94"/>
the Spirit of God, the firſt Mover, moving upon them, divided and diſtinguiſhed: whence the Separation of light from darkneſs proceeded, as alſo of diſtinct forms from confuſion, of generations from barreneſs, and of death from life: and if things in the firſt commixtion were thus confuſed, as impure with pure, Excrements with Subſtance, Earth with Heaven, and life with death; all were without action, power, eſſence and life; and the whole confuſion uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>An Artiſt therefore conſidering this, and obſerving, That nothing can exert its vertue, till the confuſion of its purity and impurity be ſeparated; he takes Water and Fire for his Helpers, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Natures copy, whoſe operations he ſhould obſerve with all curioſity, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in generating Metals, which are by ſo much the perfecter, by how much they are more digeſted in the bowels of the Earth. This ſentence is then irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable, That <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> are the ſole general and principal means of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but the compoſition of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing various, and one thing yielding with more eaſe then another, we muſt alſo
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:174321:95"/>
act variouſly upon them; yet ſo, as not to vary from the plain path, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has delineated: For aduſtion and unctuous Sulphur, making a body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable and infective, may be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted one way out of one body, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial feculency another way in others. <hi>Calcination</hi> and <hi>Sublimation,</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to purge aduſtion; but <hi>Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Diſſolution,</hi> to remove terreſtrial feculency; and <hi>Deſcenſion,</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of weak and eaſily inflammable bodies: and all theſe are either effected by fire; as Calcination, Sublimation, and Deſcenſion; or by water, as <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation</hi> and <hi>Diſſolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe both the Books of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and modern writers ſpeak at large of theſe things, I ſhall not further la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in their explication, becauſe I can adde nothing new, nor yet any orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or facility to them: it may ſuffice if I adde any thing definitively, and known to my ſelf in general; and that is, that <hi>Calcination</hi> is invented, for your overcoming of hard and rebellious things, and for continuity, and valid and firm compoſition, which hinders divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:174321:95"/>
and admits not of eaſie ſeparation: and hence four conveniencies ariſe; the combuſtion of impure and ſtinking Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, the eaſie ſeparation of ſuperfluous and extraneous earthineſs, the fixation of the internal Sulphur, and more prompt diſſolution.</p>
               <p>For it is natural to fire to conſume thoſe aduſtible parts, which are not of the eſſence of a ſubſtance, to facilitate the diviſion and rejection of terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al excrements, to fix radical Sulphur, and to multiply ſalt in bodies, which alone doth afterwards admit diſſolution by water.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that <hi>Calcination</hi> agrees onely to bodies, that becauſe of their continuity ſcarcely yield; for ſpirits and volatile things, which flye away by fire, cannot be calcined, unleſs ſome fixing thing be added, which is repugnant to their nature.</p>
               <p>Seeing there is no other end in <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination,</hi> then to extract ſalts, wherein the better part and ſecret vertue of bodies conſiſt; to which that corruptive aduſtion adheres, which in <hi>ſublimation</hi> we ſuffer ro evaporate and flie away, as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:174321:96"/>
uſeleſs; that the remaining ſubſtance may be better freed from terreſtrial dregs, and eaſier educed by fire to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification and ſtability. It is true alſo, that <hi>ſublimation</hi> requires ſome intenſion of fire; but that happens then chiefly, when the things to be ſublimated are more profoundly mixed with the dregs of ſome other fixed body, that they may more pertinaciouſly hold their terreſtrial impurities: and this kind of <hi>ſublimation</hi> is moſt ſecure, ſave when we work upon ſubjects that have their dregs naturally more fixed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſcenſion</hi> hath a two fold uſe, one is to extract Oyl out of vegetables with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out combuſtion, the other to cleanſe fuſibles bodies, before they be made volatile; and theſe are the three kindes of ſeparation made by fire: now we ſhall ſpeak a little of the other two, Diſtillation and Diſſolution, made by water; and the former of theſe is made by inclination and ſtraining, that the limpidity of bodies may with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come forth into the water of diſſolved vegetables: for that ſame that's made by an Alembick, appertains to the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:174321:96"/>
order of ſublimations, which is effected by elevation, and not by ablution. And though ſome account this for an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and but a mean way, yet I ſay it ſhould not be rejected, but much eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as that principally which Nature uſes in her operations, and which ſhe eſtabliſhes, as the ſole medium for the ſeparation of terreſtrial impurity; by which alſo many things are brought to the height of their perfection, being by this kind of diſtillation, elevated and ſublimated to their purity: Whence ſome Philoſophers have call'd it a ſecret <hi>ſublimation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond operation by water, to wit, <hi>diſſolution,</hi> is effected by moiſt and moderate heat; as Horſe-dung, Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Bath, the ſmoak of boyling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or by <hi>infuſion</hi> in water, or elſe by inhumation in moiſt places: and the end of all theſe is one, to wit, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the things calcined into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that by this liquefaction, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial matter may by ſtraining, ſettle in the bottom of the veſſel: but this ſubtile practiſe, and all of the like kind, ſhould be reiterated; for if any would
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:174321:97"/>
by continual <hi>calcination,</hi> ſeparate the more ſimple parts of the compound, and reduce to ſalt what hath the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of ſalt; he thereby creates much loſs, for the intemperate and continual violence of the fire, will ſublimate and evaporate a great part of that which is with ſuch labour ſought, ſo that nothing will remain, but a ſmall quantity of the ſoluble matter, with a great deal of dregs; and beſides, that matter may by long abode in the fire, be made into glaſs: it is better therefore to flie to frequent reiterations, then violate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the exceſs of any precinitancy. I found ſuch an inconvenience once in calcinating common Chryſtal, which while I deſired to purge from its excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and by long ignition to reduce to its true eſſence, I found both it and its excrements made into glaſs, and thence uſeleſs for my purpoſe: for though Chryſtal be clear, lucid and tranſparent, yet in Calcination it firſt emits black, and then violaceous fumes, as alſo ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſulphureous odours, which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently atteſt its excrementitious earthineſs, as alſo white fumes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:174321:97"/>
after the true Homogeneity of its ſubſtance, which remains clear and fluid in ſmall quantity, till it become true chryſtalline Salt; yea, by the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe laſt reiterations, its ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſent is changed into a moſt delicate one, like that of violets-powder. By theſe reiterations of Calcinations, two more conveniences do yet ariſe:</p>
               <p>One is, that the thing calcined by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuefaction to the fire, brings ſtability and ſubtilty to the Medicaments, as I ſaid before.</p>
               <p>The other, that a body often diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, acquires eaſie penetration, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ingreſſion; as alſo more potent ſtrength to change the ſtate of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, from ſickneſs, to ſanity; from weakneſs, to vigour; from declination, to reſtauration and perfect health: and theſe are the ordinary ways of all ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which have no other ſcope, then the purging of pure ſubſtances from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and elevating of their terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial groſſneſs to a fiery purity, and from imperfection to perfection: Which <hi>Hermes</hi> hints at, when he ſays, that earth muſt be ſeparated by fire, and the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:174321:98"/>
ſubtile from the groſs; which he ſays, muſt be done with great care and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion: For when he ſpeaks of the preparation of the univerſal Spirit after its terrification, and opens the way to the preparation of all individuals, he would ſignifie, that there is ſomething in this earth, which can ſcarce be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and conſerved; and this is a light and volatile ſpirit, which is kept by the temperament of fire.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary, it will eaſily flie away with the ſeparable and more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious volatile part, if in the operation, temperate fire and a good method be not uſed with much patience; where the Artiſt ſhould obſerve this rule with all diligence, that there are three diſtinct Sulphurs: whereof two are ſeparable, to wit, the external, which periſhes by Calcination and Diſſolution; and the internal, which vaniſhes onely by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction; and the third is fixed, which is properly the Sulphur of nature, and the proper ſubject of its ſubſtance: whereunto Philoſophers give the name of Agent, Fixed-grain, or Element of fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:174321:98"/>As to the external Sulphur, it is that firſt volatile and aduſtible water; for it is plainly extraneous, and the firſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of fire: but the internal is more rooted in, and united to the ſubſtance; and therefore yields not, ſave to intent and continued heat: and therefore it aſſumes all colours before it egrede; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning firſt with black, which is the prime ſign of earthineſs, aduſtion, and corruption, and the anteceſſor of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction and corruption; and then paſſes through other middle colours, till at length it put on whiteneſs, which is the airy colour; and then aſcends to a fiery colour, or redneſs, in which the power of art, and dominion of fire, is terminated, and beyond which there is no progreſs.</p>
               <p>Which thing the Poets fabulouſly concealed under the unconſtant form of <hi>Proteus,</hi> who turned himſelf into vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous monſtrous forms, that he might affright thoſe that would captivate him. This variety of colours proceeds from the internal Sulphur, the true author and producer of all tinctures and varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are by Nature or Art ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:174321:99"/>
in any ſubject. Theſe colours may be alſo diſtinctly noted in the decoction of the firſt univerſal Subject, as I have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſaid, That it produced them in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations: and firſt, whiteneſs preſents it ſelf, and then Natures Sulphur appears, which <hi>Geber</hi> ſays is white without, and red within: for redneſs immediately follows this whiteneſs without all help, ſave the continuation and augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Fire; whence one Philoſopher ſaid, His Stone was a Gold-Ring cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Silver.</p>
               <p>I would briefly inſert theſe few words about colours, not that I would preſume to teach the preparations and obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which I know neceſſary for the perfecting of that great and ſo much praiſed <hi>Philoſophers Elixir;</hi> but onely that I may ſhew the curious Diſciples of learned <hi>Medea,</hi> which induced by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and ingenious inquiſition, ſeek to enter the ſecrets of theſe myſterious Phyſicks, what Sulphurs muſt be rejected, and what muſt be retained in all things: I hope, I ſhall ſpend that time well, which I have ſubſtracted from my houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-affairs, if I reſtore any vigour or
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:174321:99"/>
ſpark of life, to that languiſhing part of Natural Philoſophy, which envious Men have buried in the Sepulchre of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, under the odious title of abuſive Tranſmutation and falſifying of Metals; though ignorance onely ſtop their eyes from diſcerning this true myſtery, which they load with opprobrious contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and injurious words; grounding their malice onely on the malicious lies of impudent dullards, who run about Cities, ſell ſmoak, and obnubilate their falſe Sophiſtications under the coat of this fair Virgin; deceiving the eyes of the too credulous Commonalty with their pigments, and by their Syrenical and fraudulent Speeches, precipitating curious Inquirers into <hi>Scylla</hi> or <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis.</hi>

               <p>THe Almighty Creator of all things, foreſeeing from the beginning, that infection and corruption growing with things compounded of Body and Spirit, would move continual and inteſtine wars, he oppoſed a remedy to this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention; whereby the one may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and the other not deſtroyed: and ſeeing the Spirit and Subſtance were included in a Body, and the Body im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged in corruption, it was impoſſible that corruption ſhould act upon and prevail over the Body, and yet the Spirit placed in both ſhould be kept free, and incur no danger; but rather, that with the Body it ſhould yield to deaths Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, which alwayes intends Natures deſtruction, and the proſtitution of all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:174321:100"/>
individuals: which thing needs no proof, but appears ſufficiently manifeſt, from the natural, and ſometimes the imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture end of Animals, Vegetables and Minerals, which we ſee every day by their corruption, when the Body being dead, the Spirit muſt undergo the ſame fortune; that is, the vertue that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livened it, is annihilated: but becauſe the prime Opificer would be admirable in all his works, of his meer goodneſs and love to Mankinde, who from the beginning he predeſtinated to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his Glory, and to whom he ſubjected whatever was admirable in the Creation; for his Commodity, I ſay, he gave certain expedient Remedies, whereby he might not onely purifie and perfect the things created, but alſo, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and arm himſelf againſt the aſſaults of mortal corruption.</p>
               <p>Knowing then, that the two parts of Man were one created in another, to wit, the Spirit in the Body, and that the Body would be continually infected by corruption, and by ſenſuality, drawn and allured to intemperance, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the true corruption, and weakning
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:174321:101"/>
of all the members; he foreſaw, that the Spirit inhabiting like a Gueſt in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, could not be exempted from its contagious depravation: and we ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſee, That Men given to exceſs of intemperance and ſenſuality, accuſtom themſelves to ill manners, and take liberty in all corruption, both of Minde and Spirit; neither regarding Love nor Fear to God, Honor or Reſpect to the World, nor Piety to themſelves, nor Charity towards their Neighbours. So that it is impoſſible, if they be thus bound to inquinations in death, but their Spirits muſt undergo puniſhment, as they have participated of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Seeing moreover, all mankinde by the fall of our firſt Parent, obnoxious to death, and thence every Man inevitably to incur total deſtruction and perdition; he mitigated, or rather redintegrated this Miſery by an admirable Remedy, far exceeding our capacity: for knowing Man by his Spirit and his Body to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of Heaven and of Earth, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy alſo he made to partake of Heaven and Earth, which is competible ſolely to our onely Lord, Saviour, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:174321:101"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, who deſcended from Heaven into the Earth; and by a myſtery incomprehenſible by us and common ſenſe, was miraculouſly made Man without the abdication of his God-head; becauſe our health could not come from Earth alone, corruption reigning there: but it was neceſſary, that the Water ſhould come from above, where the Fountain of purity is; he therefore came down, that he might dwell in us, and with us, and conclude us within the terms of juſtice and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; regenerating us to newneſs of life, by the mutation of our Spirit and Body, and mortifying in us our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and ſins, and reſtoring us to the ſtudy of purity of vertue; which could not have been effected ſave by him alone, the extream of both Natures; for he is God-Man, that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn ſuperiour with inferiour things, which were diſ-joyned by the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable diſtance of life and death, purity and corruption.</p>
               <p>The Earth doubtleſly received this ineſtimable treaſure far exceeding its merit, by a medium that cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:174321:102"/>
from which he again aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Heaven, by the Water of purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Fire of the Spirit, without accidents and corporal paſſions, though he depoſed not his Body, but retained it incorruptible and glorious, having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired immortality by death; who ſhall again deſcend from his Fathers right-Hand, into the Earth, after the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conflagration, to renew the World, and make a Separation betwixt the good deſtined to life, and the evil condemned to death.</p>
               <p>See now how well the Omnipotent Father, the Father of all compaſſions, conſulted for Mans good; to whoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, joyned with his Soul, he gave an equal Preſerver, whom he ſent from Heaven, that he might be born on Earth; and whom, by the light of Nature, we ought to ſeek.</p>
               <p>Seeing Man was therefore endued with Reaſon and Judgement, that he might acknowledge and comprehend his great gifts: but Man, created heavenly, for the indagation of this benefit, as too forgetful of his birth, lays out that noble and divine Light within him, in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:174321:102"/>
ſearching out frivolous and tranſitory vanities, and not in the purſuit of ſolid wiſdom and verity.</p>
               <p>Briefly, he had rather follow the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of his Terreſtrial Geniture, then Divine and Celeſtial Wiſdom, which he neglects as a thing indifferent, and caſually ſent to him from above. Wherefore the Root of Mankinde is as it were extinguiſhed before it grow out, (except ſome few who have had better Stars, and more favourable Aſpects in their Nativity) they deſiring the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of tranſitory goods, more then the attainment of Divine and precious Gifts, which our fecund Mother Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath publickly and in all places fixed, for the conſervation of life, hurt, rather then helped, by their abundance immerged in mortal corruption: And it is apparent, That thoſe that are of a higher Spirit, though they look upon the fulgour and ſplendor of thoſe Mundane Riches, as no way deſpicable; yet they will not reſt in this ſurface, but ſeek to Divine Vertue, occluded in the Centre, which hath indeed been cauſe of great errors both in Medicine and Philoſophy,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:174321:103"/>
to ſuch as deſtitute of true light, groape at, and in the dark paſs by both.</p>
               <p>Recalling then my mind to the clear light, by whoſe guidance we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſalutary and beſt remedy, which God ordained particularly for the conſervation of mankinde, and for the obtaining of Celeſtial benediction; I ſhall endeavor with all humility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite ſincerity, not as a Divine, but as a Diſciple of Wiſdoms followers, to adumbrate my conceptions in a rude ſtyle; which the lovers of verity may accept gratefully, if they finde them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and pleaſing.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that all underſtanding communicated to any man from man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, is uncertain and confuſed, becauſe man is ordinarily loaden with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſlow reſolutions; but that which he receives from the univerial Light, is clear and immoveable. For to know abſolutely, is to underſtand a thing by its firſt cauſes; and there is no certitude in ſecond cauſes, till we come to their original: wherefore we cannot know the Nature of a Species, unleſs we foreknow its Genus; neither can
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:174321:103"/>
we know the Nature of Microcoſmes (which are almoſt infinite) unleſs we firſt find out the Nature of the Macrocoſme, that gives them being. Man likewiſe cannot be known, without the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent cognition of the world, whoſe effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies he is; nor yet the great world, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we know whence and how it was made: For how ſhall one know a man, whoſe principle is nothing but a ſmall deformed mucilage? or how ſhall a man know him that is born, unleſs he know thoſe that begot him? and here I mean not the ſecond, but the firſt Parents, to wit, heaven and earth: and unleſs a man underſtand the firſt creation of theſe, how ſhall he know them? as an Embryo in a womb, which is nothing but the congregation of a certain hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which is afterwards formed to the example of its parents, and ſo in progreſs, till it become perfect: ſo the Heaven, Earth, and all that is therein, that is, all this great world, is like an Embryo in the Chaos, whence none can have any light, unleſs he conſider the firſt rudiments and progreſs of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction and formation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:174321:104"/>Let us therefore firſt go to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Spring, that we may thence trace the rivulets that flow from it, and know them, and by examples of forms judge of things formed.</p>
               <p>I ſay therefore, that the prime and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute creator (who is as a point whence all proceed, and an inexhauſtible foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whence infinite rivulets iſſue, hath a Nature proper and particular to himſelf, which is to conſerve as well as produce the whole world: for it is the property of a good Author, to produce things; and when he hath procreated them, to conſerve and defend them.</p>
               <p>This firſt Effect, which is Creation, is a ſecret that we are ignorant of; we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it not, but by the affinity or likeneſs it hath to generations.</p>
               <p>But the ſecond is open and manifeſt to ſuch, at leaſt, as are illuminated, elect, and born of the Spirit; but not to ſuch as are ſons of the fleſh, leſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearls ſhould be trod upon, and caſt to ſwine.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord hath perfected the former and more excellent, and taught us, commanding us to imitate him
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:174321:104"/>
in all good works, whereof he hath ſet us an enſample: For Nature walks always in the ſame tract, and never forſakes her ways. As therefore the univerſal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent or Conſerver, conſulted by his providence the common conſervation of all things, from the beginning of the world: So Nature from the beginning had her intentions, and was always oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupyed in continual action about pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions: For as it was neceſſary that the ſafety of the Spiritual part of man ſhould deſcend from above, ſo is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe as neceſſary, that the ſafety of the Body ſhould come from the ſame Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, becauſe from below, where the ſeat and habitation of corruption is, neither life nor ſafety can proceed. For what end do the Heavens, the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Fountain of Reſtauration and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, by the influence of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues flow upon the Body of the Earth, which the benevolent Stars, with their benign Aſpects, ſympathizing with the afflicted ſociety of mankinde, do daily graciouſly proſecute and affect, but to generate in her a durable and enlivening Spirit, which in the Womb of this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cund
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:174321:105"/>
mother aſſumes a Body, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts and dilates its faculties through all the parts of the world, diſtributing them to each creature according to its exigency: and hereupon do the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular powers depend, which we muſt know, by their effects in Herbs, Beaſts, Stones, and other things which have drawn their proprieties from this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Spirit, and do miraculouſly conſerve us and other creatures. And as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to enrich man with the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his own Son, according to the extenſion of the humane Nature, and yet he would not have any one contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with ſins and iniquities, to ſeek remedies and health from man, but from himſelf the true Fountain, whence all perfection flows: ſo alſo Nature, the perfect obſerver of the Divine will, and imitator of his works, hath not ſetled the perfect vertue of curation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration, in Herbs and particular Creatures, but would have us ſeek it preciſely in the Centre, whence this is communicated to Creatures, to wit, in the Earth, where this enlivening Spirit is generated: for if ſimples are indued
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:174321:105"/>
with the vertue of curing, reſtoring, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and conſerving how much more hath the abundant diſpenſor of it, whence all theſe receive it? but that the Earth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s the treaſury and diſpenſor of theſe vertues, daily experience gives us ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>It is therefore admirable, that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny egregious men ſhould ſpend their time in drawing their waters from ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple rivulets, far removed from their pure Fountain, and running through a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I do not in the mean time contemn ſpecial Medicaments, but I would that Generals were more ſought after, and particulars not neglected: for though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>That therefore I may return to my Scope, I ſay again, the Earth is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, wherein the Heavens beget that Spirit, that Nouriſher, Reſtorer, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:174321:106"/>
Conſerver of Bodies, which alone gives ſolidity and perfect cure: and how this ſo potent and efficacious a Spirit ſhould be found and taken, all wiſe men ſhould direct their cogitations to ſo uſeful an inquiſition, that they might obſerve the exemplary Steps, which Nature paces in perfecting her intentions; and hold this for a rule, though God infinitely excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Nature, is not bound to natural reaſon, no more then a Monarch to the Laws himſelf preſcribes, which yet his ſubject obſerve without inquiring why he preſcribed them: And who hath more faithfully and ſucceſsfully follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this example, then <hi>Hermes Triſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtus?</hi> who after the deluge, was firſt (as ſome ſay) that opened to men the myſteries of the perfect knowledge of God, and exactly explicated Natures ſecrets: for beſides that Angel-like in his <hi>Poemandrum,</hi> he explains Divinity, where he manifeſts the Doctrine of the Creation of the great and ſmall world, its beginning, progreſs, and duration; he alſo continues his holy Philoſophy with the ſame hand in his <hi>Aſclepium,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring with a ſpirit and voice prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:174321:106"/>
that the regeneration of man ſhould be wrought by the Mediation of the Son of God, indued with humane <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>leſh: he alſo induſtriouſly touches the ſame Scope in his <hi>Tabula Smaragdina,</hi> where he ſaith, that as all things in the world were made out of one ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by mediation of one God, ſo his Magiſtery, which is the chief and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Medicine, may be perfected and compleated by adaptation onely; which adaptation is nothing elſe but a Glaſs, where we may ſee Divine Meditation aenigmatically repreſented, to ſhew that Nature neceſſarily follows the ſteps of her Maſter.</p>
               <p>He alſo atteſts in other Books, That the Author of Regeneration ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from Heaven, and become Man, and live among Men for their edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He ſays alſo in his <hi>Tabula,</hi> (which he left as the laſt Teſtament and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the excellency of his thoughts) That this general Spirit, the Conſerver of Bodies, ſhall deſcend from Heaven, to wit, from the Sun and Moon (which in his <hi>Poemandrum,</hi> he calls, The prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Rulers in this Mundane Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy)
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:174321:107"/>
to aſſume a Body in the Earth, which he calls the Spirits Nurſe, by the Mediation of the Air, in whoſe Belly he ſhall be carried, becauſe the Celeſtial Influences cannot be communicated to the Earth, unleſs the Air, which is like an Interceſſor, carry them to it: and as the Divine Reſtorer and Protector of our Souls, in the aſſumption of humane Fleſh, depoſed nothing of his Divinity; ſo (ſaith he) the Univerſal Spirit ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and keep all its Vertue entire, when it is turned into Earth, that is, when it aſſumes a Terreſtrial Body.</p>
               <p>God alſo willed his own Son, and our Redeemer, in his aſſumed Humanity, be as it were regenerated by and with the Water of Baptiſm, and Fire of the Holy Spirit: not that he needed any ſuch purgation, but becauſe he was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with Men contaminated with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, that he might in all things yield himſelf an example of Renovation and Purification; giving Men a viſible and ample Teſtimony, That, according to the Fleſh, he was of the ſame Nature with them: not contaminated or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, but obnoxious to paſſion, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:174321:107"/>
equally mortal as they.</p>
               <p>In like manner, our fecund Mother Nature, willed her firſt-born, though pure in his Centre, That he ſhould be regenerated by Water and Fire, that is, by Separation of the Terreſtrial from the fiery part, the ſpiſſe from the ſubtile, and the impure from the pure: which <hi>Hermes</hi> alſo aimed at, when he ſaid, That the Earth ſhould be ſeparated from Fire: for what God hath conjoyned, Man ſhould not ſeparate; but onely the impure and groſs from the ſubtile and pure by Fire.</p>
               <p>And beſides this Senſe, which firſt offers it ſelf to our Intellects, there is yet another more occult meaning: for ſeeing by the Separation of Earth from Fire, he means, that that's groſs, from that that's ſubtile; he ſeems to hint, that we ſhould ſeparate the natural qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of theſe two Elements, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the moiſt frigidity mixt with heavy Terreſtrial things, without which that cold cannot ſubſiſt, and by putting on hot ſiccity, which is of the Nature of Fire, and conſequently light and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:174321:108"/>For which cauſe, he adds, That it muſt aſcend from Earth to Heaven, that is, from imperfection to perfection: for <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calls Fire the Firmament: and as nothing can attain perfection, unleſs it firſt depoſe its imperfect, groſs, and mortal bark, wherein this cold quality abounds, the cauſe of all morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as heat is of life; ſo alſo, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Nature obſerves this Rule, That each ſubject ſhould ſuſtain and paſs the obſure blackneſs of death, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the cleer and candid renovation of life and immortality; that is, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible eſſence, whereon neither Fire nor corruption hath any power. And aſſuredly, the acquiſition of this life by death is naturally exerciſed by all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures continually; for all Sperm or Seed of Animals is mortified in ſome Matrix, and of Vegetables in the Earth, before any ſpecification can be made. But if this rule takes place in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, by how much may we more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerve, and directly imitate it in the head? and if the life acquired by mortification, be of any duration, how much more ſhall that be perpetual, which is principal?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:174321:108"/>Jeſus Chriſt taught theſe things by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a Grain; which he ſays can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fructifie, unleſs it firſt die; ſignifying the myſtery of his Reſurrection, which his Death ſhould precede: for he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Death, that he might riſe to a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and perpetual Life: therein not onely giving example to men, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the whole Idea of Nature.</p>
               <p>That divine and learned Ermite, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienus Romanus,</hi> who is often quoted by modern and natural Philoſophers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the ſame of the fixed Grain, whereto Nature hath given power to perfect Metals: for he ſaith, Unleſs it putrefie and grow black, it cannot be perfected and compleated, but returns to nought.</p>
               <p>I have taken liberty to ſay thus much, that I may teach the younger ſort, how the Creator ſhould be acknowledged by ſimple Creatures: and becauſe the vulgarity of Men begs this knowledge from remoter things; acting as they do, who ſeek the perfection of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, from the Scholars of the loweſt Form, whereas they ſhould require it from the beſt Directors and Doctors; I
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:174321:109"/>
would excite them by theſe natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeptions, that they would convert the principal endowments of their Souls, to the ſearch of the general principle; and that in more exquiſite things, ſuch as impart life and preſervation to all mortal Creatures.</p>
               <p>Mortification then, neceſſarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes all entrance into life, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in this Spirit the firſt-born of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, when it aſſumed a Body; for elſe, no Man could ſeparate it from Body, which hinders its Regeneration to Life, and Pacification of its Eſſence: not, as though by combuſtion and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it loſt its Body in Death, nor yet by Putrefaction; but ſo, that in Germina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Putrefaction of Seeds anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilates not that which is corporified in them: for which cauſe, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altion of <hi>Mercury,</hi> or the Univerſal Spirit, after the firſt degree, which is made by Separation, all that's corporeal and ſpiritual becomes volatile, becauſe the ſublimatory vertue therein, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the fixing faculty; but the fixed part afterwards retains the volatile with it, being helped by the action of heat;
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:174321:109"/>
which augmenting the power of the two nobler Elements, deſtroyes the power of the two weaker: which <hi>Hermes</hi> hints at in a certain Treatiſe, by a plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Bird detained with a Bird with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Feathers: And <hi>Nicholaus Flumellus,</hi> by two Dragons, one with and another without Wings.</p>
               <p>But that I may not longer fold my ſelf in theſe Daedalean Labyrinths, ſee we not all Vegetables encreaſe, and elevate themſelves upwards by vertue of this volatile Spirit? which, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would carry them higher towards the place whence it came, whereto it hath an appetite, but that it is detained by its proper Earth and corporal Maſs, wherein ſome fixed matter reſides.</p>
               <p>But leſt ſome, not ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to Philoſophical terms, ſhould think we contradict our ſelves, I will here explicate my ſelf: I ſay then, That I mean not by this volatile Spirit, that which I before called volatile and ſeparable Sulphur; for that is rather the Author of Corruption then Growth: but that moſt ſimple part of the primaeve vapour, which never loſes its ſubtily,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:174321:110"/>
whoſe Nature is to be elevated, and tend to perfection; for to ſublimate, is properly and Philoſophically, no more then to perfect and exalt matters from imperfection to perfection. As therefore this <hi>Mercury</hi> hath an eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſo hath it a ſtable ſubſtance: the firſt is naturally innate in it; the ſecond is in its centre or power, yet it cannot compaſs its effect without the help of Art. And that I may ſhew more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in what ways Nature proceeds in her operations, I think it convenient to add a little about the cauſes and manner of Fixation.</p>
               <p>Repeating therefore that indubitable Axiome I alledged in the beginning of this Book, as perpetually obſerved in the Worlds Conſtitution, to wit, That all that hath life, hath alſo ſome durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that nothing is produced under the cope of Heaven, which hath not ſome kinde of life in it: I ſay, that this Duration muſt be wrought by Conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to Perpetuity: for Perpetuation is the ſcope of Nature; ſeeing it is the endeavour of every good Opificer, to preſerve the work of his hands, till it
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:174321:110"/>
be corrupted by the injury of time, or the light of its life extinguiſhed by the cold aſhes of death, to whoſe feet all things neceſſarily proſtrate themſelves, by this inevitable law, That whatſoever hath beginning, muſt alſo have an end. For if all things ſhould remain in their firſt extream, that is, in their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, without progreſs to their ſecond extream, that is, their death, all things had yet been left in their Chaos; or rather, nothing would have conſiſted in its being; and the principles of all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were uſeleſs, and deſtructive to themſelves.</p>
               <p>Nature therefore, to eſchew theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, obſerves the ſaid order and progreſs of things, exiſting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual action and motion, that is, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and perpetuation.</p>
               <p>And now, that which extends life, or conſerves it, cannot ſubſiſt againſt the force of deſtruction, without ſome fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſtancy; and this conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive eſſence, is in ſome more fixed then in others; whence they are alſo of a longer and more durable life, and more difficultly deſtroyed and mortified; as a
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:174321:111"/>
Hart and Crow, amongſt animals; an Oak, amongſt Plants; and Gold, amongſt Minerals: and this happens by the more equal and digeſted commixtion of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſo that death, whoſe property it is to divide and disjoyn, cannot ſo eaſily enter theſe compounds, as being firmly united and well digeſted; and by how much Bodies are more firm thus, by ſo much they are leſs ſubject to the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of mortal corruption.</p>
               <p>But Nature being not able of her ſelf to attain this perfection of union and digeſtion, cannot totally and finally ſave and preſerve Bodies from deſtruction; but the induſtry of Art (though Art of it ſelf be nothing without Nature) imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her in theſe things, exceeds her in the proper courſe of her own ways: for obſerving that conſervation and prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of life, is attainable by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tending to fixation, which muſt be effected by union and digeſtion (for nothing can be fixed but what is Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneous, and of one Nature) the Artiſt labours, that he may find out the thing that is fixable, and deduce it to perfect fixation; which he doth by the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:174321:111"/>
ſame ways, order and operation that Nature uſes, to wit, by ſeparating ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous, and uniting Homogeneous parts, which he abſolves by long and ingenious digeſtion of the things uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it is impoſſible for him to ſeparate or extract this from indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual and ſpecifical Bodies, becauſe of their firmer union and more compact digeſtion, he is glad to ſeek it in the bowels of the Earth, whence all things proceed: for to extract it entire and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely vertuous from another place, were a work of no profit, and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and to think how it may be made perfect, is a labour both long and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious: whence the Poet ſaid well,
<q>
                     <l>Hic ſive nullibi illud eſt quod querimus.</l>
                     <l>Here or nowhere is that we ſeek.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And they are doubtleſly deceived, who following crooked and by-paths, ſtick in the common ſignification and rind of Philoſophical words, and ſtudy not to find out the lively marrow of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:174321:112"/>
their intentions: They ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſacrifice firſt to the infernal Queen; for there is the Fountain and Spring of all things.</p>
               <p>Wiſe men begin their works from the root, and not from the branches; chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, as Doctor <hi>Bacon</hi> ſaith, to congeal the thing that Nature begun her firſt operations about, by a proportionate mixtion, and union of pure living <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> with a like quantity of Sulphur, into one Maſs: Oh holy words! where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this good Anglian, or rather Angel, clearly depinged that one and true matter, whereof all Philoſophers have writ Volumes under divers figures and Enigmatical Fables; not becauſe they would malitiouſly hide it, but keep the priviledge of this knowledge for learned and pious Men, who by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſtudy and laborious experience finde and adorn it.</p>
               <p>But leſt I ſhould move ſome maſters to ſuſpect that I alledge this place ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly, and underſtand it improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; I would have them know, that by that matter which <hi>Bacon</hi> ſo ingeniouſly repreſents, I mean the univerſal Spirit
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:174321:112"/>
whereof I treat; and likewiſe, that I put a difference between the Father and the Son; or the Genitor, and him that's Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; or the Producer, and him that is Produced: neither need I bluſh to ſay, that I know the one as well as the other: For the Philoſopher here would have ſuch enquire after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Philoſophers Stone, to ſeek the principle of Minerals; and he paints out the firſt matter of Metals, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, compounded, and ſpecified by Nature.</p>
               <p>But I treat of firſt matter not yet ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, which may be properly called the firſt matter of this firſt matter of Metals, or the moſt general Genus, ſo much celebrated by <hi>Raymundus Lullius;</hi> but I uſed this ſentence for example and authorities ſake, yet ſo as no abſurdity lurks therein: for the univerſal Spirit is the common Parent of Mercury and Sulphur, contained and proportionated by Nature, in this one Philoſophical ſubject.</p>
               <p>But I would have the curious Artiſt conſider two things: firſt, that by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile imagination he chuſe an enlivening
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:174321:113"/>
Nature, apt for the conſervation of all Bodies; the other, that he chuſe a thing which of it ſelf can enliven, and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates. Yet I would not have him to two different &amp; ſeparated Matters, chuſe the one Agent, and the other Patient; but onely one, that may at once be of vertue to enliven, and to be enlivened.</p>
               <p>As to active Vivification, I have ſaid enough; but as to the Paſſive, I ſay, That every Principle hath its Original from it ſelf: For if it ſhould have it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, it were no Principle; and while it gives being to others, it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, whilſt it generates them, draw from it ſelf reſtauration, and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al plenitude: wherefore it is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual action and motion towards vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, whereby its deſtruction is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; for it will never forſake it ſelf: and it hath motion in and from it ſelf; which <hi>Macrobius</hi> alſo diſputed in his Comment upon <hi>Scipio's</hi> dream, diſcourſing on the ſoul of man; though I think his diſcourſe may be better apted to the Soul or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the world, which is my ſubject.</p>
               <p>I will therefore borrow this from his Arguments: Whatſover is moved of it
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:174321:113"/>
ſelf, is the beginning of motion, and lives continually; and that that lives conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually cannot be enlivened but from it ſelf; it is therefore vivificable: but the Spirit of the world is ſuch, becauſe it hath its ſeat in the Earth, to convert it ſelf into Earth, wherein, as <hi>Hermes</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all it vertues, actions and qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main entire: it followes alſo, ſeeing it is vital, that it reaſſumes life, reſtoring it ſelf by its own proper power: we find the ſame alſo in this univerſal Mercury, which is always nouriſhed, and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in its Myne; ſo that if by any means it be extracted, it always grows to the ſame form whereof it was before; and whereſoever it is caſt, there will be plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it always after.</p>
               <p>Not as if it were generated of the Earth, but in the Earth, through whoſe parts it creeps, extending it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by multiplication and vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which the Ancients denote by the Serpent, which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays creeps on the Earth, &amp; feeds it ſelf on the duſt thereof: and this cauſed the <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> to call him the prince of Sepulchres, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and conſumes the Bodies there
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:174321:114"/>
interred; not that dead Bodies, or the earth, are his aliments, but only the ſeats where he is fed and nouriſhed. This is the place where he is moved, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and twines without ceaſing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Medea</hi> admoniſhes <hi>Jaſon,</hi> where ſhe ſays (in <hi>Epiſt.

               <p>I adduce theſe two Conſiderations, not onely to ſhew how <hi>Mercury</hi> muſt be ſought, but alſo to confirme, that that which is fixable in it, is nothing elſe but the enlivening eſſence, which fixed in due manner, perpetuates and keeps life in all things it enters; by its purity expelling Excrements, and by its perfection, perfecting imperfect things. The end of Fixation, both natural and artificial, is Perpetuation and Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are effected by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Tincture which <hi>Mercury</hi> acquires by this Fixation: for that Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is Life, and Life is nothing elſe but that which opens and colours the Body with ſuch a Tincture, as ſhews it to be vital, and periſhes with its death.</p>
               <p>Nature therefore colours Blood,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:174321:115"/>
wherein life conſiſts, with a red Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: and when the Blood is clearer, and more lively red, the Body is more ſound, fair and vigorous: as on the contrary, when the Blood is denſe, black, aduſt with choler, or changed into a falſe colour, the Body is pained and ſick within, and by diſcoloration gives Teſtimony thereof without.</p>
               <p>We may obſerve the ſame in Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, whoſe lively vigour conſiſts in greenneſs; which being changed, we ſay it is turning or declining towards death. The perfection alſo, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of Metals, is diſcernable by their colours. Gold is indued with a magnetical vertue, which by the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fulgor of its tincture, draws man's earth after it: in which Nature ſpends all her forces, but leaves the victory to Arts induſtry, which by graduation to the haight, which it adds to its natural ſplendor, makes it far more fulgent; inſomuch that it's called the Terreſtrial Sun.</p>
               <p>An Artiſt then may exalt the golden colour to the height of obſcure redneſs; by which augmentation, imperfect
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:174321:115"/>
Metals in a certain degree, may, by projection of this artificial Tincture, be brought to the height of perfection; ſo that we ſee this golden colour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by Nature into this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, is onely the way to that redneſs, wherein the completion of perfect Vertue lies: for which cauſe, this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, though far excelling others, can communicate no perfection nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation to humane Bodies, as a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Jugglers and Sluggards in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicks, promiſe by their Sophiſtical Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Phantaſtical Confections.</p>
               <p>But if more curious Artiſts work upon this ſubject, they may make it acquire ſuch a degree of inſeparable redneſs, that by the exceſs of its heat, it ſhall work miracles, and yet it ſhall conſume nothing but ſuperfluities, and ſhall conſerve and multiply the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bodies; though Philoſophers ſay, That its heat as much exceeds our common fires, as common fires do innate heat in Animals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paracelſus</hi> in his Treatiſe of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, extols that highly which is extracted out of Gold by Spirit of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:174321:116"/>
Wine, and attributes many ſingular Vertues to it, as alſo to that that's made of Antimony and Coral: before which, he yet ſeems to prefer the Tincture of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which he ſays may by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Fixation, be brought wholly to a Tincture, ſo that it will penetrate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, becauſe of its moſt ſubtile purity: where I think, he means not that vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, but Philoſophical <hi>Mercury,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Art, perfecting Nature, hath wrought theſe two effects, to wit, perfect Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and compleat Fixation.</p>
               <p>Tincture then in proper locution, is the pure ſubſtance of things; and Body is nothing but an Excrement: which is alſo manifeſt, in that Bodies, after the Separation of their Tincture, are uſeleſs, without vertue, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; no otherwiſe then a carcaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life, colour or motion.</p>
               <p>Tincture may then be called the ſcope of Fixation, it attaining by its permanency in fire, a conſervative fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in thoſe Bodies to which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. But the manner of attaining this degree of Fixation, in which the Completion of the whole work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:174321:116"/>
is no other, then that fugitive and light things be prudently kept in the Fire, that they may be brought into aſſuefaction with it, that they may endure moſt violent heat. And for this cauſe, good Authors commend Patience to their Diſciples, as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God; but Precipitancy, as from the Devil.</p>
               <p>Take this for an infallible Rule, That unleſs Calcination go before, nothing can be fixed; and that this ſhould be done, by conjoyning the fixable Spirit with ſomething of a convenient Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that may retain it in the Fire of Calcination, that by this means it may accuſtome it to ſuſtain heat by little, till it can endure the ultimate augmentation of Fire, which infers Fixation. And the Reaſon why we muſt proceed with ſuch diſcretion, is, becauſe, if we ſhould too readily precipitate this operation, the ſpecial Spirituality, which is the Mother of this Tincture, would flie away, and leave the Body without any impreſſion of the tingent Vertue; ſo that a new Spirit muſt of neceſſity be given to this dead Head, before the deſired co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:174321:117"/>
can be introduced, which is one of the Secrets of this Chymical Art: for it is the Spirit, and no other thing, that colours by mediation of Fire; and this Tincture compleated and exalted in our <hi>Mercury,</hi> ſhould be elevated to the height of perfection; that, as <hi>Hermes</hi> ſpeaks, it may aſcend into Heaven; and when it hath ſuſtained all mortal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, receive a new life; that is, after it hath paſſed the darkſome ſtraits of Putrefaction, it may be elevated to a Reſurrection, by the Ablation of all mortiferous and corruptive Accidents. And thus it will attain the height of perfection, which is effected by Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Earth from Fire, the ſubtile from the ſpiſs; and by Fixation of its purged part by gradual heat.</p>
               <p>But that I may ſpeak without am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bages and doubts, This aſcent into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (which is the Sublimation and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of its parts to perfection) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be effected, unleſs Separation and Purification go before, and give place to Fixation, as to the ſcope and ultimate end of Art.</p>
               <p>And here note, That this is done for
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:174321:117"/>
two ends: one is, That the Tincture may be perpetuated; the other, That the volatile and combuſtile Sulphur of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> may be ſeparated and extracted; which cannot be effected, but by the long and continual action of Fire: and this Fire muſt be regular, leſt violent precipitation in the beginning, make the pure Spirit of <hi>Mercury,</hi> not yet fixed, to aſcend: which <hi>Comes Trevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanus</hi> hints at, ſaying, That Writers differ about the ſtructure of the Fire, though they all aim at one and the ſame ſcope, to wit, That it ſhould be ſo made, that the fugitive Spirit ſhould flie away, before the perſequent ſuffered any thing from the Fire; that is, that the ſpiritual part ſhould not leave the corporal, through the ardour of the Fire, which ſhould fix it by the action of common Fire, diſcreetly applied in its ſeveral degrees; wherein the whole of this Art conſiſts.</p>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, If Fixation in the Fire communicate Permanency to this penetrating ſubtilty, how ſhall it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be ſublimated?</p>
               <p>Let ſuch take waxen Wings, and they
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:174321:118"/>
ſhall ſee, that they will have a minde to flie from this Priſon, the Earth: But they muſt minde, leſt aſcending too high, the Sun melt their Wings, and burn their Feathers, and ſo precipitate them into the Sea. But let them imitate wiſe <hi>Daedalus,</hi> who held the mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two extreams, becauſe, if he had flown too low, the Water would have loaden his Wings; if too high, the Sun would have melted his Wax. It was the impatience and blinde deſire <hi>Icarus</hi> had of overcoming <hi>Daedalus,</hi> that wrought his ruine.</p>
               <p>And whence came <hi>Phaëton</hi>'s perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ruine, when he would govern the Sun, but that he thought himſelf more apt for this work, then his Father? who admoniſhed him thus:

that I may by my induſtry advance the publike good, when the favorable Star of experience hath led me to my ſecure Port, which I would willingly impart to curious Men: For I have ſo ſucceſsfully elaborated this Univerſal Spirit, that with a ſmall quantity, I have reſtored above a hundred men, conſumed with different Diſeaſes, to ſanity: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs many excellent wits would have penetrated deeper into this obſcure and devious Wood, but that ſeeing it filled with horrid Monſters, they have been ſo confounded, as to leave this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous Path, and forſake their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>

               <p>It is certain that Nature, like a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mother, propoſes and offers this precious Treaſure of life to all; and that God our Univerſal Father, keeps open the Gate of this fatall Cavern, for the commodity of all men: for the deſcent to Hell is eaſie; but then again, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to Heaven, <hi>hic labor, hoc opus eſt:</hi> Stay coach-man, here's a ſtraw.</p>

               <p>For which cauſe I alſo in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe uſe the ſame Solennity and Tacitur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, leſt I ſhould undergo the ſame peril that he did, who publiſhed the Myſteries of the Elyſian Goddeſſes, which ſhould have been kept Secret and Chaſte, and not like common Harlots expoſed to publike abuſe: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I have ſpoken conveniently to my own purpoſe, or no, ſuch as have made progreſs in this ſearch, may better judge: for experience is the beſt Dame.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, I hope none will give a hard interpretation, or paſs a bad ſentence on me, becauſe I have compared Natural and Chymical ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, with Divine and Chriſtian Myſteries, wherewith they have ſome conformity: For by this application, I have no way profaned them, but rather Celebrated their Excellences, and poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at that great care and teſtimony of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:174321:122"/>
our Creatour, in ratifying the ſafety both of Body and Soul together.</p>
               <p>Which reaſon moved one Author, ſo that he wrote, that the true Chymiſtry, which <hi>Paracelſus</hi> calls <hi>Spagiry,</hi> follows the Goſpel foot by foot; becauſe by the help of this and fire, Nature exerts her moſt potent faculties; which Antient Philoſophers, as <hi>Brachmannus, Gymno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophiſters,</hi> and all the Egyptians, inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in their <hi>Theology.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For all the Magick of Paganiſm, and all the fables of Poets, ſignifie no more then what this Book Treats of; which the moſt Learned and ſubtile <hi>Braceſcus</hi> diligently examined; though envious <hi>Toladanus</hi> writes the contrary, after he was deceived in an experiment in this Art, which he thought he had wreſted from him by his importunity, believing that the ſpume of Iron was the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers Mercury, becauſe he aſſerted that it was extracted out of a vile Matter, of ſmall price, which was caſt into the ſtreets; not obſerving, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Maſters of this Art, cloath their Matter with ſtrange Veſtments, calling them by all the names of Metals, indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:174321:123"/>
and yet without the leaſt fraud: for he that knows this matter, knows alſo, that it contains the ſeven Metals in it.</p>
               <p>And I would gladly know, whether they think <hi>Coſmopolita</hi> meant of the vulgar Steel, when he ſayes, That <hi>Neptune</hi> ſhewed him under one Rock, two Mynes, the one of Gold, the other of Steel.</p>
               <p>The Man was too plain, to harbour ſuch frivolous conceits: but he named his matter thus, becauſe of the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with poliſhed Steel. And <hi>Braceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> had played the part of a Fool, and not a Philoſopher, if he had in one moment opened the whole myſtery of his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, in the acquiring whereof he had doubtleſsly ſpent two thirds of his life.</p>
               <p>But that I may add ſomething to the explication of theſe Mythologies, do we not plainly ſee, That that ancient <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> the Parent of all the gods, or rather of all the Members of the World, which, they ſay, inhabits the Centre of the Earth, covered with a green and ferruginous Coat, nouriſhing
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:174321:123"/>
all kindes of Animals, is nothing elſe but the univerſal Spirit, which by God's command produced the Heaven out of the Chaos, with the Elements and all things therein, which it always hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuſtains and enlivens? for it truely took up its Habitation in the middle of the Earth, as we have declared in the beginning of this Book, where it ſits as it were in its Throne; and thence, as from the Heart of ſome great Body, and Seat of Life univerſal, animates and nouriſhes all things: and that green and ferruginous Coat, is nothing but the ſurface of the Earth, which is of a blackiſh and Iron-colour, decked and variegated with divers coloured Herbs and Flowers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Virgil,</hi> perfectly skilled in all theſe myſtical Secrets, called this Spirit or Soul of the World, <hi>Jupiter;</hi> whom his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer <hi>Damaeta</hi> invokes, in his third Eclogue, becauſe, as he ſaith, all things are full of him.

               <p>He is ſometimes painted with grey and ſordid Hair, his Head covered, with a Sickle in his Hand; and for his Symbole, having a Serpent circularly grated, and holding its Tail in its Mouth: And ſure he is old enough, being the Grandfather of all: His Beard and Hairs are white, alwayes growing; which are the things that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways germinate: He is ſordid, and ill diſpoſed of himſelf, becauſe of the Terreſtrial impurity which adheres to
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:174321:125"/>
it, by reaſon of its Sulphureous and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtive Corruption: His Head is covered, that is, the principle of perfection is cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the cover of impurity, which makes it known to few: His Sickle is his Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration &amp; Mordacity, wherewith he pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates &amp; devours all things: The Serpents biting its tail, is his regenerating nature, wherby he repairs himſelf; as is ſtoried of the Phoenix, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> name he is alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called: ſo that he is always conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in a circular and indeficient encreaſe.</p>

By this Rod, he opens Heaven and Earth, and gives life and death: and that Rod repreſents powerful Nature: for by aſcending into Heaven, and deſcending to the Earth, he acquires the vertues both of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:174321:126"/>
ſuperiour and inferiour things. By this ſame power, he draws Souls out of Hell, makes all Eyes yield to Sleep, as <hi>Virgil</hi> writes of him.</p>
               <p>He is by ſome alſo called, Poyſon and a Theriack, or Life and Death, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his uſe and doſis: for Life conſiſts in due temperament and juſtice; Death, in exceſs.</p>

Polydorus.</hi> To which Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I will add, That this Name <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> that ſignifies Cogitation, Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Inveſtigation, is derived from a word that denotes a Principle, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or Reaſon: for all Meditation hath doubtleſs ſome Principle or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for its Foundation.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Medea</hi> taught <hi>Jaſon,</hi> (that is, an Inquirer) two things, wherein all Philoſophy conſiſts: firſt, The Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Golden, that is, the Art of changing Metals and Minerals. And ſecondly, The Reſtauration of Bodies weakned with Diſeaſes, readily and perfectly curing them, and bringing them from old Age to Youth and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, by this ſole and univerſal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; expelling all corrupt and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumpent humours and ſuperfluities from Bodies, which would elſe bring them to their end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jaſon</hi> endeavoured and perfected theſe miraculous effects, by the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of <hi>Medea's</hi> counſel, after long and laborious Navigation, obnoxious to many perils, both in ſailing, in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:174321:127"/>
the Dragon, and taming the Bulls.</p>
               <p>This Navigation is the laborious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, and dubious Experience of things, wherein many are exerciſed all their life long, and cannot arrive at the Port of Nature.</p>
               <p>The monſtrous Bulls which he was to tame and ſubjugate, are the Furnaces wherein the operations are made, which do not ill repreſent a Buls Head; and breath out Fire at their Mouth and Eyes, as the Fable hath it: for they muſt needs have ſome Tranſpirations, elſe the Fire would be extinguiſhed, and the degree of its heat not regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: for unleſs ſome experienced Man regulate the Fire, many things would fall out wrong in the operations, and delude the Operators hopes, as I have experienced; for of nine Veſſels, which I repoſed in a Furnace, to give it a due degree of heat, I loſt eight, and one I conſerved: by means whereof, I obtained the ſaid Experiments in curing Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The watchful Dragon, is that univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:174321:127"/>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> which <hi>Cadmus</hi> had learned to kill, that is, fix the <hi>Campus Mortis</hi> wherein the teeth of the Martial Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſhould be ſown, is nothing but a veſſel wherein Souldiers, armed with Spears, are elevated.</p>
               <p>But this Veſſel ſhould not be a Glaſs-Alembick, as <hi>Polydorus</hi> thinks, but made in form of a Cooperculum or Covert, narrow below, and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous above; made of good Earth, well cocted, and not of Iron or Glaſs. In whoſe bottom, <hi>Mars</hi> his Field muſt be elevated, rigid with Lances and Spears, repreſenting ſouldiers provoked and fighting.</p>
               <p>And this is onely an ingenious Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Poet, to make the thing ſomewhat admirable to the vulgar; which yet is ſo plain and familiar to us, that if I ſhould name what it is, I ſhould make my ſelf ridiculous.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Jaſon</hi> had finiſhed his work, he muſt needs make the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dragon, that kept the Golden Fleece, ſleep, that he might no more eructate Fire and Fume; which he did,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:174321:128"/>
by ſuffocating him in the Stygian Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that is, by diſſolving and fixing him with his Spirit. And then <hi>Jaſon</hi> had nothing to do for the poſſeſſion of the Golden Fleece, and reſtoring his old Father <hi>Aeſon</hi> to Youth again, but onely one buſineſs that <hi>Medea</hi> taught him, that is, the fermentation and conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſolar butter, with the paſte of prepared Mercury, which is not of it ſelf fit for two ſuch excellent actions; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely Earth, wherein pure ferment produced by Nature, and promoted to perfection, ſhould be ſown.</p>
               <p>When he had finiſhed this laſt work, he ſaw himſelf poſſeſſor of his twofold Treaſury, which he gloriouſly brought back to the place of his Nativity; by benefit whereof he became very rich, and reduced his aged Father to ſanity, by removing his languiſhments.</p>
               <p>But I will now leave <hi>Jaſon</hi> with his <hi>Medea,</hi> to the enjoyment of their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, and onely adde this, That by the Dragon that watched continually, and vomited fire out of his throat, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more conveniently deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:174321:128"/>
then our Univerſal Spirit or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, which is the moſt vivacious and inflammable thing in the world; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is called burning water, or <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> becauſe, as <hi>Braceſcus</hi> notes, it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways burns before its coagulation; and it is <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> becauſe it vivifies all things: And if one ſhould look on its ſuperficies, who would think it fixed, and inconſumeable, being ſo eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable, or vaniſhing at the leaſt touch of fire? or who would think, that there were any conſervative vertue in its Centre? ſeeing it looks as if it were full of mortal poyſon, rather then life?</p>
               <p>But as God ſet a Cherubim, with a flaming Sword, to keep the tree of Life: So Nature ſet this ignivomous Dragon, in the door of the Garden, to keep the Tree of golden Apples, that is, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her hidden Secrets, which our prudent Anceſtours would not deliver in writing, but onely by word of mouth, to ſuch as they thought worthy of ſuch knowledge: And this is the cauſe, why thoſe great and admirable Sciences, have in progreſs of time vaniſhed, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:174321:129"/>
are accounted as Fables and Tales.</p>
               <p>Which thing <hi>Eſdras</hi> conſidered: for foreknowing that the Iſraelites ſhould ſuffer baniſhments, flights and captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he feared leſt the ſecret Myſteries of the Scripture ſhould periſh; becauſe without the benefit of writing, mens memory might eaſily fail.</p>
               <p>He therefore Congregated all the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in number LXX, who with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wrote all theſe things in as many Books, as himſelf atteſts, ſaying, That after forty, days the Lord ſpake and ſaid, <hi>Publiſh thoſe things which thou haſt written,</hi> that all may read them: and keep thoſe later LXX Books, that thou maiſt deliver them to the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of thy people: for herein is the vein of Underſtanding, and the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Wiſdom, and the Flood of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and ſo he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Picus Mirandulanus,</hi> the Phenix of his time for Learning and Knowledge, ſpeaks of thoſe Books with great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, in theſe or the like words.</p>
               <p>Theſe are LXX Cabaliſtical Books, wherein <hi>Eſdras</hi> ſaid plainly, That the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:174321:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Fountain of all Underſtanding and Knowledge, was contained, that is, the ineſtimable <hi>Theology,</hi> concerning the Supream Deity, the Fountain of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the entire Metaphyſicks of intelligences; the ſtream of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that is, the firmeſt natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>
               <p>When theſe Books had been long kept ſecret, they were by the command of <hi>Xyſtus</hi> the fourth, turned firſt into Latine, for the benefit of Religion; but this good Work was interrupted by his death: Yet they are had in ſuch vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration amongſt the Jews, that no one under forty years of age, may touch them: And this is moſt admirable, that in thoſe Cabaliſtical Doctrines, ſome Heads of Chriſtianiſm ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Thus <hi>Mirandula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now having, I hope, omitted nothing, which might ſerve to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of <hi>Hermes</hi> his Table, or obſcure Philoſophical Cabala; I ſhall betake my ſelf to the Port of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable Ocean, and dry my wet cloathes under the Sunſhine of your
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:174321:130"/>
Favours, wiſhing well to all; and upon good grounds, judging that the Good, Honor, and Glory of the World, is the true Philoſophy.</p>
